It is up to the government to act on the vote. If it does not, we will consider a no-confidence motion.\"\n\nThe Israeli foreign ministry declined to comment on the Jordanian parliament's vote.\n\nThe Knesset Tuesday evening began a debate called by rightwingers to demand that Israel end its practice of forbidding Jewish prayer at the Al-Aqsa compound.\n\nIn a motion which was not put to a vote, MP Moshe Feiglin, a hardline member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party, said Israel's fear of igniting Muslim rage amounted to discrimination against Jews.\n\n\"Any terror organisation can raise its flag there (but) there can be no trace of the Israeli flag,\" Feiglin told the Knesset. \"Only Jews are forbidden to pray at this place.\"\n\nJews now pray at the Western Wall plaza below the compound.\n\nJordan's opposition Islamic Action Front (IAF), the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood, urged the government on Tuesday to freeze the peace deal.\n\n\"The custodianship is a Jordanian national interest and a sacred religious duty,\" said the IAF, the main opposition party.\n\nIsraeli police on Tuesday clashed with stone-throwing Palestinian protesters at the compound ahead of the Knesset debate.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa compound, which lies in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem's Old City, is a flashpoint because of its significance to both Muslims and Jews.\n\nSitting above the Western Wall plaza, it houses the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa mosques and is Islam's third-holiest site.\n\nIt is also Judaism's holiest place, being the site of the first and second Jewish temples.",

No vote was held and no decisions were taken.\n\nAn Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman had no comment on the Jordanian vote.\n\nSince the Jordanian government supports U.S. efforts to reach an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal, it \u201cis likely to ignore the lower house remarks,\u201d said Oraib Rintawi, head of the Amman-based Al Quds Centre for Political Studies.\n\nThe shrine, run by a Muslim trust known as the Waqf under Israeli security control, is a recurring flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and Israeli police clashed with Palestinian protesters ahead of yesterday\u2019s Knesset debate.\n\nMuslims believe their Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven from the compound in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City, which is home to the silver-domed Al-Aqsa Mosque and gold-capped Dome of the Rock. Jews revere it as the location of two biblical Jewish temples.\n\nIsrael captured the complex, along with the rest of east Jerusalem and the West Bank, from Jordan in 1967. It retained Waqf control over the site and forbade Jewish prayer there to avoid bloodshed. Jordan and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1994 that allowed the exchange of ambassadors.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Mohammad Tayseer in Amman at mtayseer@bloomberg.net; Donna Abu-Nasr in Beirut at dabunasr@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Andrew J.

                "text": "The Knesset debate Tuesday over Israel's sovereignty \u2013 or lack of \u2013 on the Temple Mount touched upon a subject that has always been taboo in Israeli politics: the Biblical Messianic promise of a future Greater Israel with a rebuilt Temple at its center. According to IDF Radio, while the debate was not particularly virulent by Knesset standards, the discussion \u201chas long term ramifications\u201d and can be expected to continue.\n\nMK Moshe Feiglin (Likud-Beytenu), who initiated the debate, began his speech by mentioning the 5-meter-tall brass menorah that stands in the Rose Garden outside the Knesset, as well as the smaller menorah that adorns the Knesset speaker's podium, and noting that it is largely thanks to the relief on Rome's Arch of Titus \u2013 which celebrates Rome's destruction of the Jewish Temple in 70 CE \u2013 that we know just how the Menorah looked.\n\nMK Feiglin explained that in 1967, when Israel liberated Jerusalem's Old City, \u201cthrough great miracles,\u201d the Jews \u201creceived a gift\u201d from their Heavenly Father, in the form of the Temple Mount \u2013 but then gave it away to the Muslim Waqf, choosing instead to keep only the gift's \u201cwrapping\u201d \u2013 the Western Wall, or Kotel.\n\nIDF Radio noted that while the usually rowdy Arab MKs boycotted the debate completely, centrist Likud MKs were surprisingly present and supportive. Coalition Chairman MK Yariv Levin, who was angry with Feiglin for insisting on touring the Temple Mount early in this Knesset's term, has apparently had a change of heart. \u201cThere is no living body that can function without a heart,\u201d said the secular Levin at the debate. \u201cWe need to remember this \u2013 because a right that many generations of our fellow Jews did not have, has fallen into our hands.\u201d\n\nThe messianic overtones of the debate were not lost on the ears of the Opposition. MK Eitan Cabel (Labor) sniped at Feiglin, and asked with sarcasm: \u201cWhy stop at the Temple Mount? If you are the new messiah of our times, what about the Covenant of the Parts [brit beyn habetarim \u2013 the covenant between G-d and Abraham in which G-d promised the land of Israel, from Egypt to the Euphrates, to his descendants]? What about the tribes of Reuven and Gad, and half of the tribe of Menashe [the Israelite tribes whose land was located east of the Jordan]? Why leave them behind?\u201d\n\nThe Temple Mount is Judaism's holiest site, where the two holy Temples once stood before being destroyed by the Babylonian and Roman empires, respectively.\n\nDespite its supreme importance to Jews worldwide, Jews are subject to draconian limitations on the Mount, including a ban on praying, due to the presence of an Islamic complex, administered by the Waqf Islamic Trust, and threats by Islamist groups. The Israeli police are able to bypass court decisions upholding the Jewish right to prayer there by citing unspecifiied \"security concerns\", either to ban individual activists or even to issueblanket prohibitions on Jews ascending at all.\n\nThe Knesset debate caused tension Tuesday on the Temple Mount, where Arabs threw rocks and firecrackers at police when they opened the Rambam Gate, the only entrance through which Jews are permitted to enter, injuring two policemen. Police then reportedly responded by closing down the site... to Jews. Matters on the Mount appeared to have calmed down, however, by Wednesday morning, going back to their normal abnormal state.",

                "text": "A first-of-its-kind debate over the right of non-Muslims to enter, and pray at, the Temple Mount compound in Jerusalem was held at the Knesset on Tuesday, with over 30 MKs from both right wing and left wing parties requesting to voice their opinion on the divisive topic.\n\nAlmost all of the parliament\u2019s Arab members chose not to attend the discussion in protest over the decision to hold it.\n\nThe debate, headlined \u201cthe loss of Israeli sovereignty on the Temple Mount\u201d and rescheduled from last week, was initiated by right-wing lawmaker MK Moshe Feiglin (Likud), whose visits to the Temple Mount have drawn media and police attention. Feiglin was arrested for praying there in October 2012 and January 2013, before he became an MK, and visited the Mount earlier this week ahead of the debate.\n\n\u201cThe Israeli leadership is shirking its calling,\u201d Feiglin said at the opening of the session, during which he called for Jewish freedom of worship at the site where the first and second Jewish temples once stood.\n\n\u201cBehind the back of our people we gave up on any vestige of Israeli sovereignty at the Mount. Every terrorist organization can wave their flag there, but the flag of Israel? It must not be mentioned. Reciting a psalm is grounds for arrest. Even wearing a skullcap [at the site] is inadvisable by police standards.\u201d\n\nThe Temple Mount is jointly administered by the Jordanian government and the Jerusalem-based Islamic Waqf, an arrangement that has been in place since Israel captured the Old City and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Six Day War and later annexed them. Regarded as a holy site by both Judaism and Islam, proposed changes to the status quo at the Mount are often a source of unrest.\n\nPolice restrictions bar Jews from praying or engaging in other religious activities while on visits to the Mount for fear that they will provoke a violent reaction from Muslims.\n\nMK Zahava Gal-on of the left-wing Meretz party stated that though she believes Jews have a right to pray at the Temple Mount, such a right must be expressed only after consulting with Palestinian and Arab representatives. Feiglin\u2019s proposal, Gal-on said, was \u201ca match that could ignite the powder keg on which the Middle East rests,\u201d and implementing it \u201cwould harm the peace process.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyone who today calls [on Israelis] to ascend to the Temple Mount is creating a provocation whose sole purpose is to blow up the relationship between Israel and the Arab world,\u201d she said.\n\nResponding to Gal-on, Likud MK Miri Regev said freedom of worship was not up for debate.\n\n\u201cWhy can a Muslim cry out loud in his own language that \u2018there is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his prophet and messenger,\u2019 yet a Jew cannot enter the Temple Mount and recite out loud \u2018Hear O Israel the Lord our God the Lord is One?\u2019\u201d Regev asked, concluding that \u201che who gives up on the [Temple] Mount will be left without a home.\u201d\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Israeli police were showered with stones and firecrackers on the Temple Mount, as Palestinian youth protested the debate over the contested holy site.\n\nThe clashes began when officers opened the Mughrabi Gate, an entrance to the Temple Mount next to the Western Wall that only provides access for non-Muslims.\n\nPolice dispersed The perpetrators, some of whom were masked, with stun grenades. Two police were lightly injured and three suspects were arrested.\n\nPalestinian media reported dozens of protesters were injured by rubber bullets, tear gas and stun grenades.The Ma\u2019an news agency said two Palestinians were seriously injured, one from a rubber bullet shot to the nose.\n\nHamas and Palestinian Authority officials, together with leaders of the Islamic Movement in the Galilee, have long accused Israel of planning to take control of the Muslim sites on the Mount.\n\nLast week, the planned Knesset debate drew condemnation from Jordan\u2019s parliament, whose Palestine Committee said a move to expand Israeli control over the sensitive site would be a violation of \u201cJordanian national sovereignty and is tantamount to a breach of the peace treaty signed between Jordan and Israel.\u201d\n\nTimes of Israel staff contributed to this report.",

It was originally believed to contain nine species.\n\nThe Corydiidae family of roaches is found worldwide and unlike their relatives can inhabit harsh, dry habitats and are often subterranean.\n\nFindings of the four-year study by Heidi Hopkins, a cockroach taxonomy specialist and PhD candidate at the University of New Mexico were published in the open access journal ZooKeys.\n\nHopkins said: \"The extent of the radiation of this genus is quite surprising. These animals have remarkable adaptations that allow them to succeed in some of the harshest places on earth.\n\n\"I suspect that the thorough application of modern collection methods would reveal many more species of Arenivaga across Mexico, and many more species of Corydiidae in the deserts and dry places of the rest of the world.\"\n\nArenivaga, which also known as desert or sand cockroaches, are sexually dimorphic, meaning that the females look nothing like the males. This makes the association of female specimens of a species with male specimens of the same species very difficult.\n\nShe said: \"The order Blattodea (cockroaches), which includes termites, comprise some of the earth's greatest decomposers. They are the planet's recyclers and clearly they have a role to play even in terrain with very little plant matter requiring decomposition. We can no longer think of cockroaches as creatures restricted to the moisture of the tropics.\"\n\nIn December, a new, cold-weather cockroach species able to withstand extremely low temperatures was discovered in Manhattan. Periplaneta japonica was discovered in New York's elevated High Line park. Of the estimated 4,500 cockroach species in the world, 55 are found in the United States.",

The telescope, launched in 2009, spent four productive years staring at 160,000 target stars for signs of planets passing by, relative to the telescope\u2019s line of sight.\n\nThe tally of planets announced at a NASA press conference yesterday boosted Kepler\u2019s confirmed planet count from 246 to 961.\n\nCombined with other telescopes\u2019 results, the headcount of planets beyond the solar system, or exoplanets, now numbers nearly 1,700.\n\n\u201cWe almost doubled, just today, the number of planets known to humanity,\u201d astronomer Douglas Hudgins, head of exoplanet exploration at NASA Headquarters in Washington, told reporters on a conference call.\n\nThe population boom is due to a new verification technique that analyses potential planets in batches rather than one at a time. The method was developed after scientists realised that most planets, like those in the solar system, have sibling worlds orbiting a common parent star.\n\nThe newly found planets reinforce evidence that small planets, two to three times the size of Earth, are common throughout the galaxy.\n\n\u201cLiterally, wherever (Kepler) can see them, it finds them,\u201d said astronomer Sara Seager, with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have confidence that there will be planets like Earth in other places.\u201d\n\nLike the solar system, which has eight planets plus Pluto and other so-called \u201cdwarf planets\u201d, the newly found exoplanets belong in families.\n\nBut unlike the solar system\u2019s planets, which span from inner Mercury to outer Neptune some 150 times farther from the sun than Earth, the Kepler clans are bunched in close.\n\nMost of the planets fly nearer to their parent stars than Venus orbits the sun, a distance of about 108 million km.\n\nNASA and other space agencies are designing follow-on telescopes to home in on planets in so-called \u201chabitable zones\u201d around their parent stars where temperatures would be suitable for liquid surface water.\n\nTwo papers on the new Kepler research will appear in an upcoming issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

                "text": "It\u2019s a good thing that planets outside our Solar System get catalog designations instead of proper names, or space scientists would now be scraping the barrel for \u201cRalph\u201d or \u201cTigger.\u201d That\u2019s because on Wednesday, NASA announced that the Kepler space telescope had hit the \u201cmotherload\u201d of exoplanets, confirming 715 new planets in 315 star systems. It used a new statistical technique that the space agency says has removed a bottleneck that has plagued the analysis of the Kepler data.\n\nFrom the time the unmanned Kepler probe was launched in 2009 until its at-least-temporary decommissioning last year, it surveyed about 150,000 stars. Kepler was able to detect possible planets orbiting around them, as the planets cut off part of the starlight when passing in front of the star. Using this technique, Kepler detected thousands of planetary candidates and hundreds were confirmed.\n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s a problem. Confirming these candidates has been a slow, laborious process because planets aren\u2019t the only things that orbit stars. Many times, other small, dim stars are orbiting the star under observation, which produce false positives, so astronomers need to sort out which objects orbiting a particular star are planets and which are other stars.\n\nNASA\u2019s answer to this conundrum was to employ a statistical method called \u201cmultiplicity.\u201d Unlike when Kepler started work, we now know much more about exoplanetary systems, and this data allows scientists to come to some very helpful conclusions. For example, if planets are randomly distributed in star systems, we shouldn\u2019t see very many. Instead, we see thousands of possible planets and very often more than one is orbiting a particular star.\n\nFurthermore, many star systems are similar to our own Solar System. Their orbits are in a single plane like a pancake, rather than than in intersecting orbits like the popular image of an atom. In other words, these multiple planet systems are very stable and that\u2019s where the clever bit comes in. Star systems made up of more than one star are unstable and are unlikely to have multiple planets mixed in with the orbiting stars, and that gives NASA a faster way of confirming which candidates are planets.\n\nNASA compares this technique to lions and lionesses. When you see a pride of lions, discounting cubs, it\u2019s very likely made up of one lion and a number of lionesses. If you see one cat, the odds are even that it\u2019s a lion or a lioness. If you see two, they may be a lion and a lioness or two lionesses, but less likely to be two lions. But if you see three or more, the odds are very great that its one lion and the rest are lionesses. According to NASA, the same goes for stars and planets. If you\u2019ve got more than one object orbiting a star and at least one is a planet, the odds are they\u2019re all planets.\n\nA research team at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California co-led by planetary scientist Jack Lissauer verified the technique by studying Kepler data gathered from May 2009 to March 2011. The result is not only 715 new planets, but 94 percent of them are smaller than Neptune, which is a great advance on earlier work that tended to find giant planets.\n\nAmong these are four orbiting in their stars\u2019 habitable zones where liquid water can exist and where life could be present. One of these is Kepler-296f, which is twice the size of Earth and orbits a star half the size and five percent as bright as the Sun. However, NASA points out that it may be a mini-Neptune with a thick hydrogen-helium atmosphere.\n\nAccording to NASA, this new statistical technique is already giving scientists new insights into how star systems form, and could result in hundreds more exoplanets being confirmed.\n\nThe Kepler results will be published in The Astrophysical Journal on March 10.",

                "text": "The population of known planets in the Milky Way nearly doubled Wednesday as NASA scientists announced the discovery of 715 more worlds orbiting stars other than the sun -- including four that may be suitable for life.\n\nThe discoveries were made by NASA's Kepler space telescope, a planet-hunting orbiting observatory, CNN reported. They were verified using a new technique that led the Kepler research team to concentrate its efforts on stars that had the best chance of having more than one planet.\n\nThe technique, called \"verification by multiplicity,\" is expected to lead to more frequent and more detailed discoveries of new extra-solar planets.\n\nWednesday's announcement was the largest batch of new planets introduced at one time. Until then, about 1,000 exoplanets -- planets outside our solar system -- had been announced over the years since the first was confirmed in 1992.\n\n\"We've been able to open the bottleneck to access the mother lode and deliver to you more than 20 times as many planets as has ever been found and announced at once,\" Jack Lissauer, a planetary scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in California, told CNN.\n\nThe $600 million Kepler mission was launched in 2009 to find such planets, especially ones were life could exist, NBC News said. It was to examine 150,000 stars between the constellations Lyra and Cygnus for slight dips in light. Such dips occur than a planet passes in front of its star.\n\nBefore verification by multiplicity, Kepler's findings had to be verified through other means, such as analyzing whether the suspected planet's gravity made its host star wobble, or whether the wobble was due to another star circling in the same system.\n\nHundreds of stars examined by Kepler showed multiple light blips. Some of these cases could not be caused by an eclipsing star because the resulting star system would be too unstable. Recently, astronomers learned how to figure out which ones these were.\n\nThe technique makes it easier to verify smaller planets, Jason Rowe, a member of the Kepler science team, told NBC.\n\nThe 715 new planets orbit 305 different stars. According to Rowe, 94 percent of the olanets are smaller than Neptune, a planet four times the size of Earth that orbits farthest from our sun.\n\nFour of them are roughly twice the size of Earth and orbit in their stars' habitable zones, areas where it may be warm enough to keep water liquid, Rowe said.\n\nThe announcement came nine months after Kepler's actual planet hunting ended due to a mechanical failure that robbed the spacecraft of its ability to be pointed with ultra-fine precision. The discoveries announced Wednesday came from data collected before the failure.\n\nIts finds are expected to keep coming. According to Space.com, Kepler had detected about 3,600 suspected planets and scientists believe 90 percent eventually will be confirmed.\n\nHow many may be like Earth? One research team estimates that 20 percent of the sun-like stars examined by Kepler have at least one Earth-sized planet circling in the star's habitable zone, Space.com said.\n\nScienceAtNASA released this video on YouTube further explaining the discoveries.\n\nWhat do you think of NASA's announcement?

                "text": "Mega Discovery! 715 Alien Planets Confirmed Using A New Trick On Old Kepler Data\n\nPlanet-watchers, some exciting news: you know how we keep talking about planet candidates, those planets that have yet to be confirmed, when we reveal stories about other worlds? That\u2019s because verifying that the slight dimming of a star\u2019s light is due to a planet takes time \u2013 -specifically, to have other telescopes verify it through examining gravitational wobbles on the parent star.\n\nTurns out there\u2019s a way to solve the so-called \u201cbottleneck\u201d of planet candidates vs. confirmed planets. NASA has made use of a new technique that they say will work for multi-planet systems, one that already has results: a single Kepler release of data today (Feb. 26) yielded 715 new planets in one shot. That almost doubles the amount of known planets found before today, which was just under 1,000, officials said.\n\n\u201cThis is the largest windfall of planets, not exoplanet candidates, but actual verified exoplanets announced at one time,\u201d said Doug Hudgins, a NASA exoplanet exploration program scientist based in Washington, D.C., at a press conference today. What\u2019s more, among the release were four planets (about double to 2.5 times the size of Earth) that could be considered habitable: Kepler-174 d, Kepler-296 f, Kepler-298 d, Kepler-309 c.\n\nThe findings were based on scouring the first two of Kepler\u2019s four years of data, so scientists expect there will be a lot more to come once they go through the second half. Most of the discoveries were planets close to Earth\u2019s size, showing that small planets are common in multiplanetary systems.\n\nThese planets, however, are crowded into insanely compact multiple planet systems, sometimes within the reaches of the equivalent of Mercury\u2019s or Venus\u2019 orbits. It\u2019s raising questions about how young systems would have enough material in those reaches to form planets. Perhaps planetary migration played a role, but that\u2019s still poorly understood.\n\nDiscoveries of these worlds was made with a new technique called \u201cverification by multiplicity\u201d. The challenge with the method Kepler uses \u2014 watching for starlight dimming when a planet passes in front of it \u2014 is there are other ways that same phenomenon can occur. One common reason is if the star being observed is a binary star and the second star is just barely grazing the first.\n\nThis is how the technique works: If you can imagine a star with a bunch of other stars around it, the mutual gravities of each object would throw their relative orbits into chaos. A star with a bunch of planets, however, would have a more stable orbital configuration. So if scientists see multiple transits of objects across a star\u2019s face, the assumption is that it would be several planets.\n\n\u201cThis physical difference, the fact you can\u2019t have multiple star systems that look like planetary systems, is the basis of the validation by multiplicity,\u201d said Jack Lissauer, a planetary scientist at the NASA Ames Research Center who was involved in the research.\n\nAlthough this is a new technique, the astronomers said there has been at least one published publication talking about this method, and they added that two papers based on their own research have been accepted for publication in the peer-reviewed Astrophysical Journal.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of attention on Kepler lately, not only because of its planetary finds, but also its uncertain status. In May 2013, a second of its four reaction wheels (or gyroscopes) went down, robbing the probe of its primary mission: to seek planets transiting in front of their stars in a spot in the Cygnus constellation. Since then, scientists have been working on a new method of finding planets with the spacecraft.\n\nCalled K2, it would essentially use the sun\u2019s photon \u201cpush\u201d on the spacecraft as a way to stabilize Kepler long enough to peer at different areas of the sky throughout the year. The mission is now at a senior-level review process and a decision is expected around May this year.\n\nThe spacecraft is good to go for K2 physically, NASA added, as the spacecraft only has four major malfunctions: the two reaction wheels, and 2 (out of 21) \u201cscience modules\u201d that are used for science observing. The first module failed early in the mission, while the second died during a recent K2 test. While the investigation is ongoing, NASA said that they expect it will be due to an isolated part failure and that it will have no measurable impact on doing K2.\n\nEdit, 8:30 p.m. EST: The two papers related to the Kepler discovery are available here and here on the prepublishing site Arxiv. Both are accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal. (Hat tip to Tom Barclay).",

                "text": "NASA's Kepler space telescope has discovered more than 700 new exoplanets, nearly doubling the current number of confirmed alien worlds.\n\nThe 715 newfound planets, which scientists announced today (Feb. 26), boost the total alien-world tally to between 1,500 and 1,800, depending on which of the five main extrasolar planet discovery catalogs is used. The Kepler mission is responsible for more than half of these finds, hauling in 961 exoplanets to date, with thousands more candidates awaiting confirmation by follow-up investigations.\n\n\"This is the largest windfall of planets \u2014 not exoplanet candidates, mind you, but actually validated exoplanets \u2014 that's ever been announced at one time,\" Douglas Hudgins, exoplanet exploration program scientist at NASA's Astrophysics Division in Washington, told reporters today. [Kepler's Exoplanet Bonanza Explained (Infographic)]\n\nAbout 94 percent of the new alien worlds are smaller than Neptune, researchers said, further bolstering earlier Kepler observations that suggested the Milky Way galaxy abounds with rocky planets like Earth.\n\nMost of the 715 exoplanets orbit closely to their parent stars, making them too hot to support life as we know it. But four of the worlds are less than 2.5 times the size of Earth and reside in the \"habitable zone,\" that just-right range of distances that could allow liquid water to exist on their surfaces.\n\nThe $600 million Kepler spacecraft launched in March 2009 to determine how frequently Earth-like planets occur around our galaxy. The observatory detects alien worlds by noticing the telltale brightness dips caused when they pass in front of, or transit, their parent stars from Kepler's perspective.\n\nKepler's original planet-hunting mission ended last May when the second of its four orientation-maintaining reaction wheels failed, robbing the spacecraft of its ultraprecise pointing ability. Still, scientists have expressed confidence that they will be able to achieve the mission's chief goals with the data Kepler gathered during its first four years in space.\n\nThose were very productive years. Kepler has flagged more than 3,600 planet candidates to date, and mission team members expect that about 90 percent of them will end up being the real deal.\n\nIndeed, the 715 new planets were pulled from just the first two years of Kepler observations, so more big planet-confirmation hauls could be coming as researchers work their way through the rest of the mission's huge database.\n\nAll of the 715 newfound alien planets reside in multiplanet systems, just like Earth. Taken together, the new planets orbit a total of 305 stars, researchers said. And these systems are generally reminiscent of the inner regions of our own solar system, where planets travel around the sun in circular orbits that are more or less in the same plane, they added.\n\n\"These results establish that planetary systems with mulitple planets around one star, like our own solar system, are in fact common,\" Hudgins said.\n\nScientists validated the newly discovered worlds using a powerful and sophisticated new method called \"verification by multiplicity,\" which works partly on the logic of probability.\n\nDuring its original mission, Kepler stared continuously at more than 150,000 stars, finding planet candidates around several thousand of them. If these candidates were distributed randomly, just a few would reside in multiplanet systems. But Kepler has found hundreds of such systems, a fact that helped scientists identify the 715 bona fide new planets.\n\n\"Multiplicity is a powerful technique for wholesale validation that will be used again in the future,\" said Jason Rowe of the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute in Mountain View, Calif.\n\nThe method should help researchers confirm hundreds more Kepler candidates down the road, Rowe and others said. A higher percentage of these future finds should be in the habitable zone, they added, since it takes longer for the spacecraft to detect more distantly orbiting exoplanets than ones that zip around their star in a matter of days or weeks (and researchers haven't analyzed the last two years of Kepler data using the multiplicity technique).\n\nThe studies that detail the discovery of the 715 alien worlds will be published March 10 in The Astrophyiscal Journal.\n\nThe five main exoplanet-discovery databases, and their current tallies (with the new Kepler finds included), are: the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia (1,790); the Exoplanets Catalog, run by the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo (1,790); the NASA Exoplanet Archive (1,749); the Exoplanet Orbit Database (1,490); and the Open Exoplanet Catalog (1,714).\n\nThe different numbers reported by the databases reflect the uncertainties inherent in exoplanet detection and confirmation.\n\nWhile Kepler's original mission operations have ended, the spacecraft may not be done hunting for alien planets. Team members have proposed a new mission for Kepler called K2, which would allow the observatory to search for a variety of celestial objects and phenomena, including exoplanets, supernova explosions and comets and asteroids in our own solar system.\n\nNASA is expected to make a final decision about the K2 mission proposal by this summer, officials have said.\n\nFollow Mike Wall on Twitter @michaeldwall and Google+.

As it drove along a downhill road in the early morning darkness it slammed into an 18-wheeler truck that was in front of it, Anukarn said, then spun around and went over the shoulder.\n\nPolice were searching for the driver, who fled the scene. \u201cWe suspect there might have been a problem with the brakes, because the bus looked old,\u201d Anukarn said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not ruling out the possibility that the driver might have been asleep.\u201d\n\nAnother double-decker bus carrying male students from the same school was following the girls\u2019 bus but not involved in the accident.\n\nRoad accidents are common in Thailand, where safety standards are poor and road rules are rarely enforced. Last year more than 8,600 people died in accidents on Thai roads.\n\n",

                "text": "A woman who went on a killing spree, murdering three men in 10 days, has been sentenced to spend the rest of her life in jail.\n\nJoanne Dennehy, 31, began her rampage in March last year in Peterborough. She then drove 140 miles to Hereford where she attempted to murder two other men, John Rogers and Robin Bereza.\n\nOn Friday at the Old Bailey in London, Mr Justice Spencer sentenced her to a whole-life term, meaning she will never be released. The only other woman serving a whole-life sentence is Rose West.\n\nDennehy laughed in the dock as the judge said she was \"a cruel, calculating, selfish and manipulative serial killer\". Spencer said she had a \"sadistic lust\" for blood.\n\nDennehy appeared in the dock with her accomplices Gary Stretch and Leslie Layton, who were convicted this month of offences related to her killing spree. Dennehy, wearing a pink sleeveless T-shirt, smiled and chatted during the proceedings.\n\nStretch was sentenced to life in prison and will serve a minimum of 19 years. Layton was sentenced to 14 years, and a third accomplice, Robert Moore, 55, who admitted assisting an offender, received a three-year sentence.\n\nDennehy, who was referred to in earlier proceedings as Joanna, is one of the most lethal women in English criminal history. Her first victim was Lukasz Slaboszewski, 31, who was lured to a property in Peterborough via suggestive texts and then stabbed through the heart. He had come to believe Dennehy was his girlfriend, which led him to text a friend saying \"life is beautiful\".\n\nOver the next fortnight Dennehy used a pocket knife to stab to death her housemate John Chapman, 56, and her landlord and boss, Kevin Lee, 48. In Hereford she attempted to murder two strangers within nine minutes of each other as they walked their dogs.\n\nThe judge said Dennehy had a \"psychopathic personality\" and she had provoked a \"strange fascination\" among the men.\n\nLee was found dressed in a black sequinned dress with his buttocks exposed. The judge said the body had been posed in this position in a ditch.\n\nThe court heard that Dennehy became excited at reports that police were hunting for her. As graphic and bizarre details of her acts were detailed by the judge, Dennehy appeared to laugh and smile. The court heard that she had told a psychiatrist she killed to see if she was as \"cold as I feel\" and that spilling blood became \"more-ish\".\n\nThe judge said Dennehy had written him a letter showing no remorse for the murders but claiming some for the attempted murders, which she blamed on \"drunken cruelty\" and \"lack of respect for human life\".\n\nDennehy, a mother of two, was described as \"evil\" by Robin Bereza, one of the men she attempted to murder in Hereford.\n\nThe judge said the whole life term was merited because each of the three murders involved substantial degrees of premeditation or planning. He said she had a personality disorder and suffered from diagnosed as suffering from paraphilia sadomasochism, a condition in which sexual excitement is derived from pain and humiliation. She also lacks the normal range of human emotions.\n\nDennehy is the second person to receive a whole life term this week, indeed the second since the court of appeal cleared any doubt that ordering people to be jailed until they die is lawful.\n\nOn Wednesday, Michael Adebolajo, the ringleader of the terrorist attack in which the soldier Lee Rigby was murdered, was ordered never to be released. That case was also heard in court two at the Old Bailey.\n\n\u2022 This article and the subheading were amended on 18 March 2014 to correct a quote from Mr Justice Spencer's sentencing remarks.",

                "text": "Authorities on Sunday blamed a slashing rampage that killed 29 people and wounded 143 at a train station in southern China on separatists from the country's far west, while local residents said government crackdowns had taken their toll on the alleged culprits.\n\nPolice fatally shot four of the assailants \u2014 putting the overall death toll at 33 \u2014 and captured another after the attack late Saturday in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, the official Xinhua News Agency said. But authorities were searching for at least five more of the black-clad attackers.\n\nState broadcaster CCTV said two of the assailants were women, including one of the slain and the one detained.\n\n\"All-out efforts should be made to treat the injured people, severely punish terrorists according to the law, and prevent the occurrence of similar cases,\" said China's top police official, Politburo member Meng Jianzhu, who arrived in Kunming early Sunday, an indication of how seriously authorities viewed the attack.\n\nThe attackers' identities have not been confirmed, but evidence at the scene showed that it was \"a terrorist attack carried out by Xinjiang separatist forces,\" Xinhua said. The far western region of Xinjiang is home to a simmering rebellion against Chinese rule by some members of the Muslim Uighur population, and the government has responded there with heavy-handed security.\n\nPolice in Kunming on Sunday were rounding up members of the city's small Uighur community, believed to number no more than several dozen, for questioning in the attack and information about the assailants.\n\n\"How do we know them?\" said a Uighur man who gave only his first name, Akpar. \"We could not tell if the assailants were Uighurs as they were all dressed in black. We did not like the attack either.\"\n\nMost attacks blamed on Uighur separatists take place in Xinjiang, where clashes between Uighurs and police or members of China's ethnic Han majority are frequent, but Saturday's assault happened more than 1,500 kilometers (more than 900 miles) to the southeast in Yunnan, which has not had a history of such unrest.\n\nKunming residents expressed dismay at both the attack and the conditions within China that could have allowed it to happen.\n\nRestaurant worker Xie Yulong said the attackers were \"worse than animals.\" But he also expressed sympathy toward ethnic Uighurs, saying their region has come under severe security crackdowns in recent months under the government of President Xi Jinping.\n\n\"It's the pressure,\" Xie said. \"Beijing has put too much pressure on them since Xi Jinping took over. They are under so much pressure they do not want to live, and they did that.\"\n\nAnother Kunming resident, Jiang Hua, said the attack has made people scared to go out at night.\n\n\"I think we should chase off the Uighurs and let them be independent,\" Jiang said. \"And local authorities should be held accountable for providing public safety.\"\n\nWitnesses described assailants dressed in black storming the train station late Saturday evening and slashing people indiscriminately with large knives and machetes.\n\nStudent Qiao Yunao, 16, was waiting to catch a train at the station when people started crying out and running, and then saw a man cut another man's neck, drawing blood.\n\n\"I was freaking out, and ran to a fast food store, and many people were running in there to take refuge,\" she told The Associated Press via Sina Weibo, a Chinese microblog. \"I saw two attackers, both men, one with a watermelon knife and the other with a fruit knife. They were running and chopping whoever they could.\"\n\nAlarms over a possible spread of militant attacks to soft targets beyond the borders of Xinjiang were first raised in October when a suicide car attack blamed on three ethnic Uighurs killed five people, including the attackers, at Beijing's Tiananmen Gate.\n\nSean Roberts, a cultural anthropologist at George Washington University who has studied Uighurs and China for two decades, said the Kunming violence would be a new kind of attack for ethnic Uighurs \u2014 premeditated, well-organized and outside Xinjiang \u2014 but still rudimentary in weaponry.\n\n\"If it is true that it was carried out by Uighurs, it's much different than anything we've seen to date,\" Roberts said by phone.\n\nBut he added that it is still unclear whether there is any organized Uighur militant group, and that attacks so far do not appear linked to any \"global terrorist network, because we're not seeing things like sophisticated explosives or essentially sophisticated tactics.\"\n\nThe U.N. Security Council on Sunday issued a press statement that \"condemned in the strongest terms the terrorist attack\" on the train station. The statement reiterated that \"any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivation\" and underlined the need to bring those responsible for the attack to justice.\n\nThe violence in Kunming came at a sensitive time, with political leaders in Beijing preparing for Wednesday's opening of the annual legislature, where Xi's government will deliver its first one-year work report.\n\nWilly Lam, a political observer at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the attack coming so close to the National People's Congress dented Xi's message of a \"Chinese Dream\" coalescing under his rule.\n\n\"Pockets of dissatisfaction, groups of people with grievances, appear to be increasing. After 1 1/2 years of more heavy-handed control (in Xinjiang), the report card does not look good,\" Lam said.\n\nXi called for \"all-out efforts\" to bring the culprits to justice. The Security Management Bureau, which is under the Ministry of Public Security, said in a statement that police would \"crack down on the crimes in accordance with the law without any tolerance.\"\n\nThe attack was the deadliest violence attributed to Uighur-Han conflicts since riots in the Xinjiang capital of Urumqi in 2009, in which Uighurs stormed the streets of the city, targeting Han people in seemingly random violence that included the killing of women and children. A few days later, Han vigilante mobs armed with sticks and bats attacked Uighurs in the same city. Nearly 200 people died.",

It said the attack had taken place late on Saturday evening.\n\n\"It was an organized, premeditated violent terrorist attack,\" Xinhua said.\n\nPolice were searching for around five others of the unidentified attackers, it said.\n\nKunming resident Yang Haifei told Xinhua that he was buying a ticket when he saw a group of people, mostly wearing black, rush into the station and start attacking bystanders.\n\n\"I saw a person come straight at me with a long knife and I ran away with everyone,\" he said, adding that the attackers caught those who were slower. \"They just fell on the ground.\"\n\nGraphic pictures on the Twitter-like microblogging service Sina Weibo showed bodies covered in blood lying on the ground at the station.\n\nState television showed police wrapping a long, sword-like knife in a plastic bag, amid heavy security at the station.\n\nThere was no immediate word on who was responsible.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping ordered no effort be spared to track down those behind the attack.\n\n\"Severely punish in accordance with the law the violent terrorists and resolutely crack down on those who have been swollen with arrogance,\" Xinhua quoted him as saying.\n\n\"Understand the serious and complex nation of combating terrorism,\" Xi said. \"Go all out to maintain social stability.\"\n\nDomestic security chief Meng Jianzhu was on his way to the scene, Xinhua said.\n\nWeibo users took to the service to describe details of what happened, though many of the posts were quickly deleted by government censors, especially those that described the attackers, two of whom were identified by some as women.\n\n\"No matter who, for whatever reason, or of what race, chose somewhere so crowded as a train station, and made innocent people their target - they are evil and they should go to hell,\" wrote one user.\n\nThe attack comes at a sensitive time as China gears up for the annual meeting of parliament, which opens in Beijing on Wednesday and is normally accompanied by a tightening of security across the country.\n\nChina has blamed similar incidents in the past on Islamist militants operating in the restive far western region of Xinjiang, though such attacks have generally been limited to Xinjiang itself.\n\nChina says its first major suicide attack, in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in October, involved militants from Xinjiang, home to the Muslim Uighur people, many of whom chafe at Chinese restrictions on their culture and religion.\n\nHu Xijin, editor of the influential Global Times newspaper, published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, wrote on his Weibo feed that the government should say who it suspected of the attack as soon as possible.\n\n\"If it was Xinjiang separatists, it needs to be announced promptly, as hearsay should not be allowed to fill the vacuum,\" Hu wrote.",

                "text": "The Olympic Truce, or ekecheria, is based on an ancient Greek tradition, dating back to the ninth century B.C. All conflicts ceased during the period of the Truce, which began seven days prior to the opening of the Olympic Games and ended on the seventh day following the closing of the Games, so that athletes, artists, their relatives and pilgrims could travel safely to the Olympic Games and afterwards return to their countries.\n\nThe sacred Greek tradition of ekecheiria (truce) constituted the cornerstone of the Olympic Games in ancient times, providing safety and a peaceful environment for both the athletes competing in the Games and for the spectators in attendance. Its very adoption was dictated by the oracle of Delphi as a way to put an end to the wars that at the time devastated the Peloponnese. The longest lasting peace accord in history was thus created.\n\nOlympism was revived in 1896, aiming at contributing to a peaceful future for mankind through the educational value of sport. The Olympic Movement brings together the youth of the world in a great sports festival, promoting peace, friendship, solidarity and fair play.\n\nSince 1993, support for the Olympic Truce has grown steadily within the General Assembly, reaching the unprecedented unanimous co-sponsorship of the latest resolution. During these turbulent times, Member States are demonstrating their confidence in the Olympic Truce Ideal.\n\nToday the Olympic Truce has become an expression of mankind's desire to build a world based on the rules of fair competition, peace, humanity and reconciliation. Moreover, the Olympic Truce epitomizes a bridge from the old and wise tradition to the most compelling purpose of the United Nations \u2013 the maintenance of international peace and security. As the most visible illustration of this connection in goals and aspirations between the Olympic movement and the United Nations, the International Olympic Committee decided, starting from 1998, to fly the United Nations flag at all competition sites of the Olympic Games.\n\nThe application of the Olympic Truce to the Paralympic Games and its relating recognition of the rights of persons with disabilities is another important achievement building on the General Assembly resolutions. The power of sport to achieve social inclusion and encourage the active participation of persons with disabilities on an equitable basis with others was directly demonstrated. (A/65/270, para.7)\n\nValiant attempts have consistently been made by the United Nations in an effort to bring peace and stability to the troubled regions of the world. That goal may still remain elusive, but if the Olympic Truce can help us to bring about even a brief respite from conflict and strife it will send a powerful message of hope to the international community.",

Sergey Bobok/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUkrainians react as guards take their places in front of government buildings and Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin gains approval to send troops into Crimea, Ukraine.\n\n\u2014 Russian troops took control of vital installations across the Crimean Peninsula on Saturday, and Russian President Vladimir Putin secured authorization to send in more as the Kremlin set the stage for a high-stakes international showdown over the future of Ukraine.\n\nOn Sunday, Ukraine's leader urged Putin to pull back his military, saying \"we are on the brink of disaster,\" according to the Associated Press.\n\nArseniy Yatsenyuk, Ukraine\u2019s new prime minister, spoke after a closed session of his new parliament in Kiev.\n\nOn Saturday, the interim president of Ukraine, Oleksandr Turchynov, said, \u201cWe consider the behavior of the Russian Federation to be direct aggression against the sovereignty of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nHours later, President Obama, who had warned Putin on Friday against military intervention in Crimea, had an apparently tense 90-minute telephone exchange with the Russian president. Obama said that a refusal by Russia to send troops back to their bases in Ukraine would \u201cimpact Russia\u2019s standing in the international community.\u201d According to the Kremlin, Putin argued that Ukrainian \u201cultranationalists\u201d were threatening \u201cthe lives and health of Russian citizens\u201d in Crimea.\n\nOn Sunday, a convoy of hundreds of Russian troops was seen headed toward Simferopol, the regional capital, the Associated Press reports.\n\nIn Crimea and in cities across eastern Ukraine, where opposition to Kiev\u2019s new government runs high, Russia\u2019s aggressive stance gladdened the hearts of thousands of protesters. Russian flags were raised in Donetsk, and a group of pro-government activists who had occupied the main government building in Kharkiv were beaten and routed by pro-Russian protesters. More than 100 were reported injured.\n\nBut Ukrainian nationalist groups in the country\u2019s west vowed to mobilize against the Russian threat.\n\nRussia and the West find themselves on the brink of a confrontation far more perilous than in 2008 over Georgia, Dmitri Trenin of the Carnegie Moscow Center wrote on his blog, referring to Russia\u2019s previous war. The Ukrainian military, which has taken part in NATO operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and partnered frequently with its Polish counterpart, is far smaller than Russia\u2019s. But if a confrontation should erupt, the Russians would find that Ukraine\u2019s forces are better equipped and trained than Georgia\u2019s were.\n\nStill, Russia has worked since 2008 to improve its military capabilities, through reforms and increased spending.\n\nThe pressure on Kiev, where a new government was sworn in Thursday after the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych, is intense. Vitali Klitschko, leader of the UDAR party and a candidate for president, called for a general mobilization to thwart the Russians.\n\nOn Saturday, Ukraine\u2019s new prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, called for \u201cthe government and authorities of Russia to recall their forces and to return them to their stations. Russian partners, stop provoking civil and military confrontation in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nPutin\u2019s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said the Russian president had not decided whether to use the authorization to send in more troops.\n\nPutin may choose not to push the Crimean crisis any further, said Mark Galeotti, a New York University professor and Russian security expert in Moscow.\n\n\u201cAnything more than that would be trickier and messier,\u201d Galeotti said. \u201cIn classic Putin style, he\u2019s increasing tension. He\u2019s trying to make sure Kiev understands it has to consider Russian interests in whatever post-Yanukovych order emerges. I don\u2019t think Russia wants to annex Crimea. It wants to make sure its bases are protected and its client regions are given the most autonomy they can arrange.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s decision to authorize troops came in what appeared to be a highly orchestrated series of steps, beginning with a plea to Moscow for fraternal assistance from Crimea\u2019s new leader. And it raises as many questions about what kind of country Russia will become as it does about Ukraine.\n\nJust last Sunday night, Putin was sitting in Sochi\u2019s Fisht Stadium for the Closing Ceremonies of the Winter Olympics. Thomas Bach, the head of the International Olympic Committee, declared, \u201cYou send a powerful message from Sochi to the world: the message of a society of peace, tolerance and respect.\u201d\n\nThe next night, more than 400 Russians were rounded up in Moscow, protesting prison terms for anti-Putin demonstrators. Later in the week, opposition leader Alexei Navalny was put under house arrest for two months.\n\nAnd now, troops for Ukraine.\n\nBut the members of the upper house of Russia\u2019s parliament, who voted unanimously to give Putin a free hand to deploy troops to Ukraine, appeared to be delighted. They also appealed to him to recall the Russian ambassador to Washington, to show displeasure over what they described as threats by Obama over Ukraine.\n\nIn Crimea, helmeted soldiers with military-style rifles, without insignia and declining to state their nationality, stood guard at, or encircled, government installations. Troops patrolled the airport in Simferopol, which was closed to air traffic, and stood in front of the council of ministers and regional parliament, where a Russian flag flew from the roof. Soldiers also control the military airport at Belbek.\n\nEarlier in the day, the new prime minister of the Crimea region, Serhiy Aksyonov, appealed to Putin for help maintaining \u201cpeace and tranquility.\u201d\n\nIn short order, the Russian Foreign Ministry claimed that \u201cunidentified gunmen directed from Kiev\u201d had tried to capture the Crimean Interior Ministry headquarters. Calling the attempt a \u201ctreacherous provocation,\u201d Moscow said, \u201cWe believe it is irresponsible to continue whipping up the already tense situation in the Crimea.\u201d\n\nIgor Aveytskiy, who was named by the Kiev government to serve as chief of Crimea\u2019s national police, said there was no attack.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all rumors, all lies,\u201d said Mikhail Amirov, a member of a pro-Russia self-\n\ndefense militia on guard in front of the headquarters building\n\nBut Moscow apparently had the allegation it needed.\n\nA committee of the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, asked Putin to intervene. He made his request, and the Federation Council, the upper house, promptly gave it unanimous approval. The authorization does not limit the troops to Crimea but allows them to be sent to all of Ukraine.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, 10 troop carriers, accompanied by armored jeeps, arrived at the Ukrainian coast guard base in the resort town of Balaklava and took up positions inside and outside the installation. Russian Orthodox priests stood among the troops and sang hymns.\n\nLarge crowds gathered to wave Russian flags wherever the troops appeared.\n\nThe Crimea regional government, dominated by pro-Russia deputies, announced it would hold a referendum March 30 to decide among three choices: \u201cto retain its current status as an autonomous republic within Ukraine, to become an independent state, or to become part of Russia,\u201d according to the Russian news agency RIA Novosti.\n\nIn Kiev, Klitschko called on the Verkhovna Rada, or Ukrainian parliament, to renounce the agreement permitting the Russian navy to maintain its base in Sevastopol.\n\nLesya Orobets, a member of the Rada and an organizer of the protest movement, wrote on Facebook that \u201cpeople who were no longer afraid of their mad dictator\u201d and were able to overthrow him \u2014 a reference to the ousted Yanukovych \u2014 \u201cshould not be afraid of another dictator.\u201d\n\nSteven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who helped negotiate a 1994 memorandum on Ukrainian territorial sovereignty, tweeted Saturday that there is \u201cno doubt in my mind that Russia is violating its commitments.\u201d\n\nIn Kharkiv, police stood by as protesters swarmed into a building occupied by activists who support the new government, beating their opponents before hoisting Russian and Ukrainian flags. Tens of thousands of people gathered in the morning to protest the Maidan revolution.\n\nThe assault on the building was \u201ccompletely spontaneous,\u201d said Denis Levshinko, a sociology student who participated in the rout of the Maidan activists. \u201cWe are all fed up with them. We united, and we chased them out.\u201d\n\nMany of the occupiers were taken captive and dragged onto the street, where, forced to their knees, they apologized to the jubilant crowds.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re drug addicts,\u201d one woman said. \u201cThey\u2019re no better than frozen vegetables.\u201d\n\nEnglund reported from Kiev; Booth reported from Simferopol.

However, there has been no sign of ethnic Russians facing attacks in Crimea, where they make up about 60 per cent of the population, or elsewhere in Ukraine.\n\nIn response to the escalating crisis, Prime Minister Stephen Harper called an emergency cabinet meeting Saturday, after which he announced Canada was recalling its ambassador from Moscow and pulling out of preparations for the upcoming G8 Summit to be held in Sochi, Russia.\n\n\u201cIf (Putin) continues with this provocative action, there\u2019s certainly no way I or Canada would want to have anything to do with Russian world leadership,\u201d Baird said of the upcoming meeting.\n\nWATCH: Dozens of protesters in Toronto are holding signs decrying Russian President Vladimir Putin for the military troop deployment in Crimea, Ukraine.\n\n\n\nThe minister was adamant Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s actions are completely unjustified and even \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has no right to invade another country, a neighbouring country that\u2019s struggling for freedom and democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe excuses and rhetoric coming out of Moscow are unacceptable. No one is buying them in the Western world and they make President Putin look ridiculous.\u201d\n\nRussia is also preparing to launch the Paralympics next week in Sochi, where Baird said he is reconsidering any government involvement, though Canada will not boycott the games.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want the athletes to pay the price for this,\u201d he said. \u201cBut politically \u2026 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way we\u2019d want to have senior-level government leadership going there to somehow glorify Russia\u2019s leadership.\u201d\n\nThe UK announced Sunday that their government ministers will be boycotting the Paralympics in Sochi.\n\n*With files from The Associated Press",

The prince is patron of the British Paralympic Association and was due to attend the Sochi Games for three days next week.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, got in a little retaliation against the west when its main television channel announced it would no longer show the Oscar ceremony.

However, should the situation escalate significantly in the next few days some Paralympic associations could come under political pressure to reconsider.\n\nA British Paralympic Association said there had as yet been no change of plan for its 15 athletes.

We are looking forward to a great 2014 Paralympic Winter Games.\"\n\nIn a statement on Saturday the International Paralympic Committee said it hoped to see Russia adhere to the Olympic truce, a tradition backed by a UN resolution that asks nations to cease hostilities during the Olympics and Paralympics. It said: \"We want the story here to be the great festival of sport that has already taken place in Sochi and will continue now that athletes are arriving for the start of the Winter Paralympics.\"\n\nRussia experienced a lesser degree of political pressure over the Sochi Olympics, mainly connected to its law against disseminating gay \"propaganda\" to children and wider human rights issues. Britain was represented by the relatively lowly culture secretary, Maria Miller, rather than Cameron, seen as something of a snub since London had held the previous Games. Other leaders to stay away included Barack Obama, Angela Merkel and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.\n\nThe concept of the Olympic truce, codified by a UN resolution in 1993, came in the wake of the tit-for-tat boycotts of Summer Olympics that badly affected the 1980 and 1984 Games. Dozens of nations withdrew their athletes from the 1980 Moscow event in protest at the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, including the US, West Germany and Canada. British athletes took part, despite domestic political pressure to stay away.\n\nFour years later in Los Angeles the Soviet Union and more than a dozen other communist nations and allies opted to not compete, officially because of fears about anti-Soviet feeling in the US.",

                "text": "Ukraine mobilized for war on Sunday and Washington threatened to isolate Russia economically, after President Vladimir Putin declared he had the right to invade his neighbour in Moscow's biggest confrontation with the West since the Cold War.\n\n\"This is not a threat: this is actually the declaration of war to my country,\" Ukraine's Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk, head of a pro-Western government that took power when Russian ally Viktor Yanukovich fled last week, said in English.\n\nPutin secured permission from his parliament on Saturday to use military force to protect Russian citizens in Ukraine and told U.S. President Barack Obama he had the right to defend Russian interests and nationals, spurning Western pleas not to intervene.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Russia's military incursion into Ukraine \"an incredible act of aggression.\" Kerry will travel to Kyiv, Ukraine, on Tuesday to stress U.S. political and economic support.\n\nRussian forces have already bloodlessly seized Crimea \u2014 an isolated Black Sea peninsula where Moscow has a naval base. On Sunday, they surrounded several small Ukrainian military outposts there and demanded the Ukrainian troops disarm.\n\nCanada's Foreign Minister John Baird condemned Russia's moves and called on Putin to stop his \"provocative and dangerous course of actions,\" urging the Russian leader to withdraw his troops in the Crimea back to their bases. He reiterated that Canada had recalled its ambassador in Moscow and is boycotting the G8 preparations in Sochi, in a news conference Sunday from Toronto.\n\nThe minister sidestepped questions about a boycott and when questioned about sanctions, he spoke about Canada talking to allies, NATO and the UN about further steps.\n\n\"Non-participation in the G8 will hurt Russia,\" said NDP Leader Tom Mulcair at a Sunday news conference. \"Having the international community condemn as one this totally illegal invasion of a sovereign country will help send a signal even to the most obtuse regime like the Putin regime.\"\n\nIn Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, Yatsenyuk said there was no reason for Russia to invade Ukraine and warned that \"we are on the brink of disaster.\"\n\nBut so far, his new government and other countries have been powerless to stop Russia's military tactics. Armed men in uniforms without insignia have moved freely about the peninsula, occupying airports, smashing equipment at an air base and besieging a Ukrainian infantry base.\n\n\"Ukraine is calling up all army reservists, getting this country combat ready,\" CBC News correspondent Susan Ormiston said, reporting from Crimea. \"We were at a naval base not far from the capital of Crimea, where hundreds of Russian troops have surrounded the base. They blocked the gates with the Ukrainian army inside, but no violence.\"\n\nOrmiston said there are reports the Ukrainian army is trying to protect its own caches of munitions.\n\n\"The city feels like it's still functioning. The doors are open,\" CBC News correspondent Nahlah Ayed reported from Western-sympathetic Kyiv. \"But there's definitely apprehension here. They don't know where it's going. But this isn't really tangible on the ground as you are travelling around Kyiv.\"\n\nThe BBC is reporting that Russian soldiers are digging trenches where the Crimea peninsula meets the mainland.\n\nUkrainian officials announced Sunday that the head of the country's Black Sea fleet has been removed and is under investigation for treason. They say Denis Berezovsky did not provide resistance when the Russian army seized the port of Sevastopol, the headquarters of Ukrainian naval forces.\n\nRussia has long wanted to reclaim the lush Crimean Peninsula, which was part of Russia until 1954. Its Black Sea Fleet is stationed there and nearly 60 per cent of Crimea's residents identify themselves as Russian.\n\nUkraine's population of 46 million has divided loyalties between Russia and Europe, with much of western Ukraine advocating closer ties with the EU, while eastern and southern regions like Crimea look to Russia for support.\n\nUnidentified troops pulled up to the Ukrainian military base at Perevalne on the Crimean Peninsula in a convoy that included at least 13 trucks and four armoured vehicles with mounted machine guns. The trucks carried 30 soldiers each and had Russian licence plates.\n\nA dozen Ukrainian soldiers placed a tank at the base's gate, leaving the two sides in a tense standoff.\n\nUkraine's acting president, Oleksandr Turchynov, announced late Saturday that he had ordered Ukraine's armed forces to be at full readiness because of the threat of \"potential aggression.\"\n\nTurchynov also said he had ordered stepped-up security at nuclear power plants, airports and other strategic infrastructure.\n\nBut the U.S. and other Western governments have few options to counter Russia's military moves.\n\nIn Brussels, NATO's secretary general said Russia had violated the UN charter with its military action in Ukraine, and he urged Moscow to \"de-escalate the tensions.\"\n\nNATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen spoke before a meeting Sunday of the alliance's political decision-making body to discuss the crisis and asked \"all parties to urgently continue all efforts to move away from this dangerous situation.\"\n\nUkraine is not a NATO member, meaning the U.S. and Europe are not obligated to come to its defence. But Ukraine has taken part in some alliance military exercises and contributed troops to its response force.\n\nKerry, interviewed on Sunday news shows in the U.S., raised the possibility of boycotting the G8 summit, which is to be held in June in Sochi, the Russia resort that just hosted the Winter Olympics. He also discussed visa bans, asset freezes, and trade and investment penalties.\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama spoke with Putin by telephone for 90 minutes Saturday and expressed his \"deep concern\" about \"Russia's clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" the White House said. Obama warned that Russia's \"continued violation of international law will lead to greater political and economic isolation.\"\n\nIn Moscow, thousands marched Sunday in a pro-invasion rally one day after Russia's parliament gave Putin a green light to use military force in Ukraine. At least 10,000 people bearing Russian flags marched freely through the city, while dozens of people demonstrating on Red Square against an invasion of Ukraine were quickly detained by Russian riot police.\n\nThe new Ukrainian government came to power last week following months of pro-democracy protests against a pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, and his decision to turn Ukraine toward Russia instead of the European Union.\n\nYanukovych fled to Russia after more than 80 people died, most of them demonstrators killed by police. He insists he's still president.\n\nSince then, tensions have risen sharply between the two capitals.\n\nThe Interfax news agency reported the speaker of Crimea's legislature, Vladimir Konstantinov, as saying the local authorities did not recognize the government in Kyiv. He said a planned referendum on March 30 would ask voters about the region's future status.\n\nThe White House said the U.S. will suspend participation in preparatory meetings for the Group of Eight economic summit planned.\n\nCanadian athletes will still compete in the upcoming Paralympics in Sochi, the Prime Minister's Office said late Saturday. The games are set for March 7 to March 16.\n\nAlso on Saturday, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Canada supports the United Nations sending international monitors to Ukraine and is also involved in multilateral talks to put together a financial aid package for the beleaguered country.\n\nOn Sunday, Britain said it will suspend its participation in preparations for a G8 meeting in Sochi. British Prime Minister David Cameron said U.K. cabinet ministers will stay away from the Sochi Paralympics due to the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said on Europe 1 radio that planning for the summit should be put on hold. France \"condemns the Russian military escalation\" in Ukraine, and Moscow must \"realize that decisions have costs,\" he said Sunday.\n\n\"We are on a very dangerous track of increasing tensions,\" German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said in a statement. \"[But] it is still possible to turn around. A new division of Europe can still be prevented.\"",

Winning a silver medal in giant slalom with my brother BJ at the world championships in La Molina, Spain, Feb. 2013.\n\nWorst moment in ski racing? Missing the second-to-last gate in slalom at the world championships in La Molina , Spain.\n\nWhat is your Paralympic dream? To win gold at the 2014 Sochi Paralympic Winter Games with my brother BJ as my guide.\n\nWhat is the best thing about having the 2014 Paralympic Winter Games in Sochi, Russia? A great country to experience with my teammates and my family.\n\nIf you could listen to one song before leaving the start gate, what would it be? \u201cLose Yourself\u201d Eminem\n\nIf you could bring any three people in the world - living or from the past - to one of your races, who would they be? My mom Lee, my dad Bill, and my sister Avery because they have encouraged me to let nothing hold me back and to follow my dreams.\n\nHidden talent: I like to race stock cars. It\u2019s such a rush!\n\nIf you had just one day left to live, how would you spend it? I would start with heli-skiing in Alaska and end with fishing somewhere beautiful with my friends and family.\n\nIf you could own a business or be trained in any career other than ski racing, what would you choose? I would like to be a sports psychologist so that I can help athletes work on their dynamics and become the best they can be.\n\nWhen I\u2019m not skiing, you can probably find me: fishing, four-wheeling or at the race track.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best thing about your hometown? I live on the North shore of Lake Superior with a great beach and some of the best freshwater fishing in the world.\n\nWhat's the most surprising thing in your suitcase when you\u2019re on the road? Treats or notes from home. I love finding those hidden when I\u2019m away as it lets me know that people are thinking about me when I am away.\n\nWhat's your favourite thing to eat or drink during race season? My favourite thing to eat is chocolate! And of course Swiss chocolate is the best.\n\nIf you could design your own World Cup spot anywhere in the world, where would it be? I wish we could have a World Cup race in Northern Ontario so all of my friends and family could come out to watch us ski.\n\nWhere is your favourite place to race or train? My favourite place to race and train Saas-Fee, Switzerland. The snow is great there, and it was cool to be up on the glaciers. Oh, and don\u2019t forget the chocolate!\n\nIf you could have one superpower, what would it be? I would like to be able to fly to enjoy that kind of freedom.\n\nIf you could build your dream home anywhere in the world, where would it be? I would live on the North shore of Lake Superior, because there is no place like home.\n\nWhat\u2019s the funniest thing you\u2019ve seen a teammate do while on the road? Watching former teammate Mike Whitney jump when someone scared him.\n\nWho is someone you admire in sport? I admire the time and dedication that my brother BJ has put into this sport to help me live out my dream. I also aspire to become as successful in my career as my teammate Chris Williamson.",

                "text": "Ukraine is in the midst of cracking in two. While pro-Europe progressives in the west of the country have taken control, Putin is tightening the screws on Crimea in the pro-Russia east.\n\nOn Saturday, Putin used that as part of a pretext to request of parliament (i.e. to instruct parliament) that Russian troops be moved over the border as a \u2014 you\u2019re going to love this \u2014 \u201cstabilizing contingent.\u201d\n\nNATO is trying to figure out how much blood (if any) a country without oil is worth. The Sochi Olympics are shaping up as the $50-billion cocktail party that preceded the proxy war.\n\nPutin succeeded in his public-relations goal, abetted by all the rest of us. That\u2019s the IOC\u2019s cross to bear, though I doubt they\u2019ll care no matter how badly this turns out.\n\nThe IOC is no longer a sports endeavour. It\u2019s a money-laundering operation. You exchange dirty cash for a clean reputation. This can only last so long, but people continue to be distracted by the dupes who are pushed out front \u2014 the athletes.\n\nIf they were in the wrong to pick Sochi, the rest of the world can be forgiven for showing up. We have more right to enjoy the Olympics than the IOC does to screw them up.\n\nBut Sochi\u2019s not over. Given the events of the past few days, we don\u2019t get any more free passes on the basis of ignorance.\n\nWhereas the able-bodied Olympians have World Cups and professional gigs to tide them through the Olympiad, Paralympians work almost entirely toward these 10 days every four years.\n\nThe International Paralympic Committee did at least provide some rationale to the Associated Press: \u201cWe want the story here to be the great festival of sport that has already taken place in Sochi and will continue now that the athletes are arriving for the start of the Winter Paralympics.\u201d\n\nToo often, we cannot engage it directly. Canada will not fight on Ukraine\u2019s behalf, and nor should it. This would be a good point to think hard about Iraq.\n\nThe greatest danger of any civil war is contagion. Canada\u2019s work is limiting whatever humanitarian disaster is about to occur, not jumping into the middle of it.\n\nHowever, we can no longer pretend there is any territory left that exists above the fray. Every gesture we make now is fraught with significance. Participating in a Russian sports event on Russian soil is a tacit endorsement of Russia.\n\nIt would be like finding out that the friend who\u2019s hosting the party is up on a murder charge, but going anyway because it sounds like fun.\n\nHowever much we want to, we can\u2019t be seen whooping it up in Sochi, while 10 hours drive to the west, the Kremlin is in the midst of taking over a sovereign nation.\n\nIt would negate that sad showing at Canada House two weekends ago. I can\u2019t erase the image of COC boss Marcel Aubut gushing to Putin about \u201c\u2026 great Games, probably the best ever.\u201d Just as he\u2019s about to launch a second broadside of flattery, Putin yanks the mic away and says, in English, \u201cWe did our best.\u201d",

                "text": "GERRY Collins, who was the face of a national anti- smoking campaign, has died.Mr Collins (57), from Greystones, originally took part in a HSE anti smoking campaign in 2011 after overcoming throat cancer three years earlier.\n\nHowever, in June last year, Gerry was diagnosed with the disease for a second time, with doctors informing him he had terminal lung cancer and had less than a year to live.\n\nAfter initially struggling with the news, Gerry eventually came to terms with the situation and got in contact with the HSE. He then agreed to became the face of a new campaign to highlight the dangers of smoking.\n\nThe campaign, which included a number of ads depicting Gerry at family gatherings in his home as well as training at his local GAA club, was launched last December and he appeared on RTE's Saturday Night Show last January to urge people to quit smoking.\n\nMr Collins is survived by his wife Delly and children Lisa, Ciara and Stephen.\n\nHis eldest daughter Lisa paid tribute to her father on Facebook saying: \"Our Dad, Gerry Collins, passed away this morning peacefully in his sleep and a 'happy man'.\"\n\nShe said that the family were lucky enough to be there with him to hold his hand and say goodbye adding: \"We love you dearly xxxx.\"\n\nAt the launch of his campaign last year, Gerry said the ads were an opportunity to show the dangers of smoking and that he took solace from the fact he would be able to say goodbye to his family unlike those who die suddenly.\n\n\"I hope to continue in the fight against smoking,\" he said in December. For me, it's a nice legacy to leave behind.\n\n\"People who are killed in a car crash never get to say goodbye. I've an opportunity to say goodbye. As sad and all as it is for the family, they're very lucky.\n\n\"If I can get through the day with a bit of peace and contentment every day, that's good enough for me. If I can spend time with the kids, I'm happy with that.\"\n\nSpeaking following news of Gerry's passing, parish priest in Greystones Fr Liam Belton praised the advocate for his work in highlighting the dangers of smoking.\n\n\"The man has suffered but he certainly has been instrumental in bringing the dangers of smoking to the public's attention,\" he said. \"The campaign certainly caught the attention of the people.\n\n\"I didn't know him personally but we extend our great sympathy to all his family.\"\n\nHe said Gerry's abilities to communicate the effects of smoking were an important contribution in getting people to quit.\n\n\"It's very sad because I understand there was going to be a big anti smoking launch on Ash Wednesday. Traditionally people in the Catholic Church give up something for Lent and cigarettes and drink used to be a great thing to give up.\n\n\"Certainly the ads were very good. I also saw him on a chat show programme on television. He was a very good communicator and has made a very important contribution in highlighting the seriousness of smoking.\"\n\nGerry Collins: 'My biggest fear now is how I will die. I hope I get to die peacefully'",

                "text": "Wheelchair curler Sonja Gaudet will lead Team Canada into the Opening Ceremonies during the Sochi Winter Paralympic Games starting March 7, 2014 in Sochi, Russia. Photo by\n\nSOCHI \u2013 Sonja Gaudet had modest goals when she took up the relatively new sport of wheelchair curling a decade ago, six years after a fall from a horse left her paralyzed from the chest down.\n\nThe now 47-year-old mother of two from Vernon was simply looking for a relatively low stress sport that she could play with her able-bodied husband.\n\nBut it quickly morphed into a passion for promoting sport for those with a disability and for championing accessibility issues in her community.\n\nAlong the way, Gaudet became a pretty good curler and the wheelchair game\u2019s most decorated athlete.\n\nOn Wednesday, the two-time Paralympic gold medalist, three-time world champion and first wheelchair curler to be inducted into the Canadian Curling Hall of Fame, was named the Canadian team flag bearer for Friday\u2019s opening ceremonies of the 2014 Games.\n\n\u201cTotally honored . . . very happy and a lot of emotion, for sure,\u201d said Gaudet at a news conference at which she received a Canadian flag from swimmer Benoit Huot, who was the closing ceremonies flag bearer at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London.\n\nShe was informed she had been selected Tuesday night at the athlete\u2019s village and she was permitted to make a quick call home to her husband, Dan, who was unable to make the trip to Sochi.\n\n\u201cI actually probably had too much time to think, but I got to cry for a couple of hours, all good emotions,\u201d said Gaudet, who grew up in North Vancouver.\n\n\u201cThis carries a lot of purpose for me. We\u2019re here to compete as athletes with a physical disability at the highest level . . . and for me (that) sends a big global message about looking past the wheelchair, the visual impairment, looking past the missing limb and really focusing on the person and what\u2019s there.\n\n\u201c(The Canadian Paralympic Committee ad campaign) says it perfectly. We don\u2019t want people to see what they see what they see when they first see us. We want them to see the athlete, the person and not notice what\u2019s missing, but notice what\u2019s there. And that\u2019s ability.\u201d\n\nJoe Rea, who has been coaching the Canadian wheelchair team since 2006, said Gaudet, who is an ambassador with the Rick Hansen Foundation and the CPC, is a terrific choice as flag bearer.\n\n\u201cShe has been a pillar of the wheelchair community. She\u2019s just a great person and I\u2019m so happy for her.\u201d\n\nGaudet, who throws lead stones, won gold in 2006 at Turin as a member of skip Chris Daw\u2019s rink when wheelchair curling made its Paralympic debut. She was the only member of that team to return in 2010 when the Canadian rink, then skipped by six-time Brier participant Jim Armstrong, won gold again.\n\nGaudet, Armstrong, a long-time Richmond resident who now lives in Cambridge, Ont., and second Ina Forrest of Armstrong, B.C., are joined in Sochi by Paralympic first-timers Dennis Thiessen of Sanford, Man., and alternate Mark Ideson of London, Ont.\n\nThat same rink won world championship gold at the Ice Cube in Sochi last year. They went 9-2 for the week, beating Sweden 4-3 in the final.\n\nFor that reason, the Armstrong rink is considered the gold medal favorites in the 10-country competition.\n\nCanada plays twice on opening day Saturday, facing long-time rival Great Britain in the morning and the host country Russia, which won the 2012 worlds, in the afternoon.\n\n\u201cWe feel really good,\u201d said Gaudet of the rink\u2019s confidence level. \u201cThis team, honestly, we\u2019re a five-person strong team. We know each other so well now.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been here, we\u2019re comfortable here. We know what to expect at the venue. We\u2019re in a very good place.\u201d\n\nGaudet said she doesn\u2019t anticipate any problems holding the flag pole during the opening ceremonies, noting that it can probably be affixed to the bracing post she has on her curling chair, a device that gives her more stability and allows her to throw harder.\n\n\u201cI have a pretty strong brace on there already. A little bit of duct tape on there and we\u2019re good to go.\u201d",

It did so because of Mafarja\u2019s youth, the absence of fatalities, and the possibility that the charge would not necessarily result in a life sentence.\n\n\n\nMafarja was convicted of performing an act that showed intent to assist an enemy, attempted murder, causing the explosion of explosive material, and causing serious bodily harm.\n\n\n\nOriginally from the West Bank, Mafarja was able to move within the Green Line and acquire Israeli identification documents after a family reunification.\n\n\n\nAccording to prosecutors, on the morning of the bombing, Mafarja spent a few hours riding around on several different buses in Tel Aviv while carrying the bomb, looking for a bus full of passengers.\n\n\n\nEventually, he got on a crowded bus, a No. 142 from Ramat Gan to Tel Aviv.\n\n\n\nJust before he arrived at a bus stop at the Ramat Gan industrial district, Mafarja activated the bomb, left it on the third seat on the righthand side of the bus, and got off. He called one of his associates immediately afterward and told him that the bomb was in place. Minutes later, the bus arrived near the corner of Shaul Hamelech Boulevard and Henrietta Szold Street, where the bomb was detonated.\n\n\n\nProsecutors said that, after Mafarja got off the bus, he took a train from the Savidor station back to Modi\u2019in, where he returned to his job at the McDonald\u2019s eatery in the Azrieli Mall.\n\n\n\nThe Shin Bet and police said that several hours after the bombing they arrested Mafarja and the other members of the Beit Likya-based cell.\n\n\n\nIndictments have been filed against several other suspects who prosecutors claimed were part of the \u201cmilitary cell\u201d from the Ramallah area, which they said also plotted to carry out suicide bombings and shooting attacks against politicians and soldiers.\n\n\n\nIn January, the Military Advocate-General\u2019s Office filed an indictment with the West Bank Military Court of Judea against the alleged mastermind of the bus bombing, Ahmad Salah Ahmad Musa, a 25-year-old resident of Beit Likya.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

                "text": "Rail Maritime and Transport union leader Bob Crow has died at the age of 52 of a suspected heart attack.\n\nLeading the RMT from 2002, Mr Crow became one of Britain's most high-profile union leaders.\n\nUnion, industry and political figures have been paying tribute to him.\n\nLondon Mayor Boris Johnson, who often clashed with him, said Mr Crow had \"fought tirelessly\" for his members. Labour's Ed Miliband said he had been a \"passionate\" campaigner.\n\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said David Cameron offered his sincere condolences to Mr Crow's family and friends.\n\nAnd Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said Mr Crow had been a \"fighter and a force\".\n\nMr Crow was elected general secretary of the RMT in 2002 following the death of former leader Jimmy Knapp.\n\nUnder his leadership, the RMT's membership increased by more than 20,000 to 80,000.\n\nThe union's president Peter Pinkney said Mr Crow's death \"represents a huge loss to the trade union and labour movement both in this country and internationally\".\n\nThe BBC's political editor Nick Robinson said Mr Crow \"was, some argue, the most successful union leader in terms of securing jobs and pay for his members\".\n\nContinue reading the main story In life, Bob Crow embodied his team Millwall's famous song, \"No-one likes us, we don't care\". In death, those who once condemned him and who he regarded as his enemies - Tory cabinet ministers, the Mayor of London and, yes, the leader of the Labour Party - have lined up to praise him (though in the case of Ed Miliband not on camera) as a fighter for those he regarded as his people. Crow, in my experience, was simply unmoved by the views of the political and media establishment. Few doubt that he was not just one of the best known but also one of the most effective trade union leaders in terms of doing the job he was paid to do: protecting the job security of his members, increasing their pay and improving their conditions. Behind the public displays of aggression was a man, it is widely said, who was willing and capable of striking a deal in private. This was a man who knew what he thought, knew whose side he was on and knew who the enemy were in an era when that can be said of a shrinking number of people in public life.\n\nWhile he was supported by his members, Mr Crow was often criticised by some politicians and parts of the media when the union decided to take industrial action - sometimes to the consternation of London's commuters.\n\nJust last month thousands of Tube passengers endured delays because of strike action over planned job cuts and ticket office closures.\n\nMr Johnson said: \"This was a guy who really fought for his members and who stuck up for his point of view.\n\n\"Obviously I didn't always agree with what he had to say but... together with other union members, Bob Crow unquestionably helped to drive through huge progress on London Underground, and he leaves a massive legacy behind.\"\n\nMr Johnson's predecessor Ken Livingstone said: \"If you think in terms of what's a tribute to him, I can't think of any other job that working class people do that's got good wages and conditions and a pension - all the others have been eroded.\"\n\nTransport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said Mr Crow had made \"an important contribution to the debate around the future of rail services in this country\".\n\nMr Miliband said Mr Crow had been \"a major figure in the Labour movement and was loved and deeply respected by his members\".\n\nHe added that Mr Crow had been a \"passionate defender of and campaigner for safe, affordable public transport\" and a \"lifelong anti-fascist activist\".\n\n\"I didn't always agree with him politically but I always respected his tireless commitment to fighting for the men and women in his union.\"\n\nBorn in 1961 in east London, he got his first job on the underground at the age of 16, fixing rails and cutting down trees by the track.\n\nHe became a local representative for the then National Union of Railwaymen at the age of 20, rising through the ranks before becoming general secretary of the RMT - which was formed by the combining of the National Union of Railwaymen and the Seamen's Union in 1990.\n\nLast month, Mr Crow joined his members on the picket line during the Tube strike.\n\nManuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, which also took part in the strike, said: \"Bob Crow was admired by his members and feared by employers, which is exactly how he liked it.\n\n\"It was a privilege to campaign and fight alongside him because he never gave an inch.\"\n\nMr Crow did not attend a TUC executive away day on Monday because he felt unwell.\n\nHis older brother Richard told Sky News he believed the union leader had suffered a heart attack early on Tuesday, and paid tribute to the \"loveable little rogue\".\n\n\"We grew up together in Chigwell in Essex and he was a very likeable chap - no matter what people said about his politics,\" he said.\n\n\"He was honest, he looked after the people he was supposed to look after, and he was a great man as far as honesty and beliefs went.\"\n\nHe added: \"When people have a high office in life they fall for the big trappings of the flash cars and the big hotels and big houses. But Bob wasn't like that, he was a genuine person of the people.\"\n\nIn an interview broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on the day before he died, Mr Crow described himself as \"talkative\", but said he did not like to be \"gobby\".\n\n\"At the end of the day, to be a general secretary of a union you've got to be larger than life,\" he said.\n\n\"[You can't] walk around with a grey suit on and eat a cheese sandwich every lunch time. You want someone who's got a bit of spark about them.\"\n\nHe also defended his salary, which was reported to be \u00a3145,000 but he suggested was closer to \u00a390,000, saying he was worth it because RMT's members had received pay rises every year even during austerity, had good pensions and had good holiday allowances.\n\nTUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said he was \"an outstanding trade unionist, who tirelessly fought for his members, his industry and the wider trade union movement\".\n\nPaul Kenny, GMB general secretary, added: \"Even people who didn't like what he did agreed he did it very well.\"\n\nDave Nellist, national chairman of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, which Mr Crow had co-founded in 2010, said: \"Bob Crow was an inspirational union leader who tenaciously defended his members' jobs, pay and conditions - head and shoulders above most other union leaders.\"",

                "text": "Figures across the political spectrum have paid tribute to Bob Crow, whose sudden death has deprived the union movement of arguably its most colourful and successful modern leader.\n\nCrow, the general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union, died aged 52 early on Tuesday morning at Whipps Cross hospital in Leytonstone, east London, after reportedly suffering an aneurysm and a heart attack.\n\nHe had been the RMT's leader since 2001, growing a reputation as a militant champion of workers, with his apparently unfashionable politics seeing the union add tens of thousands of recruits after it repeatedly won pay rises for its members.\n\nCrow's most recent high-profile battle was over the future of London Underground, with talks continuing after strikes last month.\n\nTributes were led by the city's former mayor Ken Livingstone, who said that while Crow was demonised by the rightwing press: \"The only working-class people who still have well-paid jobs in London are his members. With the passage of time, people will come to see that people like Bob Crow did a very good job.\"\n\nThe mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said he had been shocked to learn of the death of \"a fighter and a man of character\".\n\nThe RMT left the Labour party in 2004 after a number of disagreements over policy, although for years the union used to send its annual affiliation fee to the party, only to have the cheque returned.\n\nLabour leader Ed Miliband said: \"Bob Crow was a major figure in the labour movement and was loved and deeply respected by his members. He did what he was elected to do, was not afraid of controversy and was always out supporting his members across the country.\"\n\nThe convenor of the RMT parliamentary group, Labour MP John McDonnell, said: \"In Bob Crow we have lost one of the finest trade union leaders and socialists our movement has known. I am devastated by this tragic news.\"\n\nA spokesman for David Cameron said he expressed his sincere condolences to Crow's family and friends.\n\nPatrick McLoughlin, the transport secretary, said: \"Like many, I will remember him as a passionate voice for safety on the railways and the wellbeing of those who work on them.\"\n\nTUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: \"Bob was an outstanding trade unionist, who tirelessly fought for his members, his industry and the wider trade union movement.\"\n\nThe Labour leader, Ed Miliband, said: \"Bob Crow was a major figure in the labour movement and was loved and deeply respected by his members.\n\n\"I didn't always agree with him politically but I always respected his tireless commitment to fighting for the men and women in his union. He did what he was elected to do, was not afraid of controversy and was always out supporting his members across the country.\"\n\nCrow left school at 16 to work on the tube, and became a local union rep for the first time aged 20. In later years, the shaven-headed, Millwall-supporting Crow was easily caricatured in the rightwing press \u2013 particularly during tube strikes or when his union demanded, and won, Olympic bonuses for workers. But while he was unafraid to call a strike, associates remember him as a shrewd negotiator who knew when to settle and how to play his hand.\n\nHis defiance over his well-publicised cruise holiday to Brazil on the eve of the recent tube strike was typical: why, he asked, wasn't a working man allowed to spend his money on a holiday? It had been advertised in the Daily Mail.\n\nIn one of his last interviews, he told the BBC: \"At the end of the day, to be the general secretary of a union you have to be larger than life. I wouldn't want to walk around in a grey suit and eat a cheese sandwich every lunchtime. I'd want someone who's got a bit of sparkle about them.\"\n\nCrow's death came during talks over the tube's future, as the union continued to resist plans to shut ticket offices and cut jobs. Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA union, which had joined the dispute with the RMT, said he was \"proud and privileged to have stood alongside Bob\". He added: \"While many bosses might not have said it in public, he carried their respect. He understood that his job was to get the best possible deal for his members. That is what he always did.\"\n\nThe offices of the RMT union were closed on Tuesday. The RMT said it would make further announcements in due course.\n\nIt is understood that Millwall football club will include a tribute to Crow in its programme for the game against Charlton on Saturday.",

Some reports suggest Mr Crow had been unwell for some time.\n\nFormer Mayor of London Ken Livingstone led tributes to Mr Crow saying he fought for his members despite being demonised by the right wing press. Speaking of his shock at the news, he said: \"I assumed he would be at my funeral not me at his.\"\n\nHe told Sky News: \"He fought really hard for his members. The only working-class people who still have well-paid jobs in London are his members.\"\n\nHe said Mr Crow was \"broadly right on most key issues\" and that if more people had fought for the conditions of the working classes \"this country would be a much better place.\"\n\n\"With the passage of time people will come to see that people like Bob Crow did a very good job,\" he said.\n\nThe RMT confirmed Mr Crow's death \"with the deepest regret\".\n\nA brief statement said: \"It is with the deepest regret that RMT has to confirm that our general secretary Bob Crow sadly passed away in the early hours of this morning.\n\n\"RMT would request that all media respect the privacy of the friends and family of Bob Crow at this distressing time.\"\n\nMr Crow was most recently involved in a controversial Tube worker's strike over plans to close ticket offices on the London Underground.\n\nCrow's trade union career saw him frequently at loggerheads with management and the government. He became assistant general secretary of the RMT in 1991, before being elected leader in 2002.\n\nUnder Mr Crow's leadership, membership of the RMT increased by more than 20,000 to 80,000, embracing workers ranging from seafarers and rail staff to cleaners.\n\nHe spoke at rallies and meetings most weekends, and was always in demand to support campaigns.\n\nA former member of the Communist Party of Great Britain and the Socialist Labour party his hard left rhetoric was often criticised by those on the right and the centre left.\n\nMr Crow was regarded as a member of the so-called \u201cAwkward Squad\u201d - the loose grouping of left-wing union leaders who came to power in a series of electoral victories beginning in 2002.\n\nMr Crow's death caused shockwaves in the trade union movement and across the political spectrum.\n\nManuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, who stood on picket lines with Mr Crow during last month's Tube strike, said: \"Bob Crow was admired by his members and feared by employers, which is exactly how he liked it.\n\n\"It was a privilege to campaign and fight alongside him because he never gave an inch.\"\n\nSir Peter Hendy, London's Transport Commissioner, said: \"We are shocked by this terribly sad and unexpected news. Our thoughts are with Bob Crow's family, friends and all those he represented.\"\n\nUK Independence Party (Ukip) leader Nigel Farage tweeted: \"Sad at the death of Bob Crow. I liked him and he also realised working-class people were having their chances damaged by the EU.\"\n\nMr Crow had been campaigning for the No2EU political party in May's European elections, arguing that workers were suffering because of policies from Europe.\n\nMr Crow's older brother, Richard Crow, said he believed the union leader had suffered a heart attack in the early hours of today.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News, he paid tribute to the \"loveable little rogue\".\n\nRichard, whose father was also a trade union leader, said: \"It's very sad.\n\n\"It was about 7am that I got the call (from my sister). I presume some time in the night he had some problems. We're really trying to find out exactly what happened.\n\n\"We grew up together in Chigwell in Essex and he was a very likeable chap - no matter what people said about his politics.\n\n\"He was honest, he looked after the people he was supposed to look after, and he was a great man as far as honesty and beliefs went.\n\n\"He was a person who believed in justice.\"\n\nEd Miliband said: \"Bob Crow was a major figure in the labour movement and was loved and deeply respected by his members.\n\n\"I didn't always agree with him politically but I always respected his tireless commitment to fighting for the men and women in his union. He did what he was elected to do, was not afraid of controversy and was always out supporting his members across the country.\n\n\"He was a passionate defender of and campaigner for safe, affordable public transport and was a lifelong anti-fascist activist.\n\n\"My thoughts are with his family, friends and colleagues in the RMT and wider union movement at this difficult time.\"\n\nIn a statement, London Mayor Boris Johnson said: \"I'm shocked. Bob Crow was a fighter and a man of character.\n\n\"Whatever our political differences, and there were many, this is tragic news.\n\n\"Bob fought tirelessly for his beliefs and for his members.\n\n\"There can be absolutely no doubt that he played a big part in the success of the Tube, and he shared my goal to make transport in London an even greater success. It's a sad day.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister's official spokesman said: \"The Prime Minister expresses his sincere condolences to Mr Crow's family and friends.''",

                "text": "The first legal challenge in US federal court to force-feeding at Guant\u00c3\u00a1namo is being brought on behalf of Emad Hassan. Photograph: Guardian\n\nHunger-striking Guant\u00e1namo detainees are being subjected to a form of torture known as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwater cure\u00e2\u0080\u009d that was widely used in the Spanish Inquisition, lawyers are claiming, in the first legal challenge to force-feeding at the military base brought before a US federal court.\n\nThe case was lodged on Tuesday in the US district court for the DC circuit that has jurisdiction over Guant\u00e1namo. It was brought on behalf of Emad Abdullah Hassan, a Yemeni who has been on hunger strike in the detention camp intermittently since 2005 and continuously since 2007.\n\nBy his lawyers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 reckoning, Hassan has been force-fed more than 5,000 times during that period, in conditions they allege are abusive, illegal under international law, and a form of torture. The motion calls for a preliminary injunction that would put an immediate halt on the practice pending full review.\n\nThe legal move is the first of its kind to be brought before the civilian courts following last month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision by a federal appeals court to allow such a challenge to go ahead. It paves the way for the first comprehensive hearing in the US judicial system over the legality and propriety of the military\u00e2\u0080\u0099s controversial use of force-feeding at Guant\u00e1namo.\n\nHassan, now 34, was picked up by Pakistani security forces in February 2002, having travelled from his native Yemen to Faisalbad to attend university. He has been held without charge for almost 12 years in Guant\u00e1namo, despite the fact that he was cleared for release in 2009.\n\nThe legal motion, together with testimony from Clive Stafford Smith, founder of the human rights organisation Reprieve, which is co-sponsoring the challenge, gives gruesome details of Hassan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s treatment at the hands of US military guards and military doctors administering the feeding regime. Since November 2005, techniques have been used that the lawyers allege are designed to inflict pain and humiliation on the prisoner in the hope of persuading him to give up his hunger strike.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 using feeding tubes that are too big to be inserted into the prisoner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nostrils without causing great pain;\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 insisting on inserting and removing the tube for each feed, rather than leaving it in for prolonged periods, causing repeated agony twice a day;\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 restraining Hassan in what he and other detainees call the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctorture chair\u00e2\u0080\u009d in which his hands, legs, waist, shoulders and head are strapped down tightly;\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 giving the prisoners a laxative drug at the same time as feeding, causing them to defecate while in the restraint chair and then leaving them in their own filth.\n\nThe technique also includes what Hassan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers liken to the medieval torture of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwater cure\u00e2\u0080\u009d, where large volumes of liquids are forced into detainees\u00e2\u0080\u0099 stomachs at excessive speed, causing severe enteral pain. As much as 2,300ml of fluid may be passed down the tube in just 20 to 30 minutes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a method that an expert witness in the case, retired military doctor Stephen Xenakis, said \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoes not conform to standards of medical care\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nThe legal challenge stresses that Hassan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intention on going on hunger strike is not to commit suicide, and that he does not want to die. Rather, he is inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, among others, to conduct \u00e2\u0080\u009ca peaceful protest against indefinite detention without charge or trial\u00e2\u0080\u009d, the motion says.\n\nHassan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers argue that an acceptable alternative to Guant\u00e1namo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current force-feeding regime can be found in the US federal bureau of prisons regulations. They stipulate that detainees should only be force-fed if a physician determines that they are facing an imminent risk of death or great bodily injury.\n\nEven then, \u00e2\u0080\u009conly that amount of force necessary to gain control of the inmate\u00e2\u0080\u009d should be applied, the regulations state.",

Hassan is a 34-year-old Yemeni national who, Stafford Smith said, has mounted a \u201ccontinuous hunger strike\u201d since 2007.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time that any court will compare what the prisoners are saying about the torturous methods with what the military is saying,\u201d said Clive Stafford Smith, director of London-based human rights group Reprieve and the legal counsel in the case.\n\nA Yemeni inmate at the U.S. military prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay on Tuesday launched the first court bid to make the military respond to allegations of inhumane force-feeding of the prison\u2019s hunger strikers .\n\nDuring the forced feedings, Hassan told Stafford Smith, inmates are given food supplements \u2014 some of which have reportedly led to pancreatitis \u2014 as well as anti-constipation medicines and over half a gallon of water. Stafford Smith said this cocktail is generally administered in 20 to 30 minutes.\n\n\u201cIn my clinical experience, the rapid infusion of liquids and enteral feedings induces pain and considerable discomfort,\u201d retired 28-year Army medical corps officer Stephen Xenakis said in legal documents obtained by Al Jazeera.\n\n\n\nIf the inmate vomits, the whole process is repeated, according to Stafford Smith\u2019s report of Hassan\u2019s account.\n\nHassan reportedly told prison officials he had sinus problems in his right nostril but feeding tubes were forced in through that nostril anyway.\n\nHe also told Stafford Smith that in response to nausea due to the forced feedings, he was forced to take Reglan, a drug that, Stafford Smith said, \u201cmade him feel crazy.\u201d\n\nWhile on the drug, Hassan \u201cwould sit on his bed, legs folded, thinking that he was talking to the nurse, but he actually found that he was talking to himself,\u201d Stafford Smith said in his declaration, which is being filed in District Court in Washington, D.C.\n\nOther alleged measures to dissuade hunger strikers included barring hunger strikers from participating in communal prayers during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\n\nStafford Smith said in his court filing that the last time he met his client, Hassan \u2014 who is 5 feet 3 inches tall and weighed 119 pounds before his incarceration \u2014 weighed 85 pounds and was in \u201cvery bad\u201d health. At one point, during a previous hunger strike, Hassan\u2019s weight reportedly dropped to 78 pounds.\n\n\u201cThis motion invokes this court\u2019s habeas jurisdiction to do something about the festering wound of human rights violations that the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay has become,\u201d reads Stafford Smith\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nHis filing to challenge alleged force-feeding practices at Guant\u00e1namo on behalf of Hassan was launched against Obama as the chief defendant.\n\nObama, Stafford Smith says, is \u201cultimately responsible for the detention.\u201d Advocates such as Stafford Smith say Obama has made little progress on his longstanding pledge to close the military detention facility. The U.S. secretary of defense and the commander of Guant\u00e1namo have also been mentioned in the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cI have written to the Obama administration. The key is whether they recognize that if they are serious about closing Guant\u00e1namo, that is all that these men are asking for,\u201d Stafford Smith said.\n\nThe White House told Al Jazeera that despite Obama\u2019s being listed as the principle defendant in the case, the Defense Department should answer questions regarding the treatment of Guant\u00e1namo detainees.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Defense has responsibility for the health, welfare and humane treatment of detainees at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, and I would refer you to them for further questions about the specifics of their policies and procedures,\u201d said White House National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden.\n\nA Defense Department representative said that since the lawsuit involves the president, he is unable to address the issue. \u201cWe surely don\u2019t comment on issues mentioning the president,\u201d Lt. Col. Todd Breasseale told Al Jazeera.\n\nBut he did say that whatever information Stafford Smith has on practices at Guant\u00e1namo are from biased sources. \u201cBoth the detainee and Reprieve have a specific agenda. That agenda may not comport with the truth or reality,\u201d Breasseale said.\n\nStafford Smith says he hopes that the legal challenge will force the military to respond to allegations like Hassan\u2019s, revealing its version of practices previously kept a secret from the public.\n\n\u201cWe have asked for a preliminary injunction, which puts time schedules in place that are quite short \u2014 around 20 days normally,\u201d Stafford Smith said.\n\nA Washington, D.C., Court of Appeals decision in Aamer v. Obama, handed down last month, ruled that federal judges have the jurisdiction to rule on Guant\u00e1namo force-feeding cases, which Stafford Smith has said opens the way for courts to decide on the legal action introduced Tuesday.\n\nHassan, originally handed over to the United States by Pakistani authorities under suspicions of conspiracy with armed groups, was cleared for release in 2009, meaning that the U.S. military no longer found him to be a threat.",

                "text": "Most of the remaining detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base prison have now joined a hunger strike. This is not the first time Gitmo detainees have gone on a hunger strike, but the current strike has drawn more attention than past uses of the tactic did, both because it is so widespread and because of the plight of many of the detainees: they have been held for years and cleared for release, but the U.S. government will not allow them to settle here, and has been unable to find a country that will take them.\n\nIn response to the hunger strike, the prison has adopted a policy of forcibly feeding those detainees who are at greatest risk of starving themselves to death. Human rights groups and medical authorities condemn such forced feeding as cruel, but the authorities reply that it is better than permitting the detainees to die.\n\nIs the forced feeding of hunger strikers\u2014typically through a tube inserted through the nose and then down into the stomach\u2014legal? Hunger strikes have been used for political causes for over a century: By suffragists in Britain and the United States in the early Twentieth Century; by Mahatma Gandhi for a variety of causes in the 1930s and 1940s; by jailed IRA activists in the early 1980s; and by individual prisoners and groups of prisoners protesting their conditions of confinement in the U.S. and elsewhere to this day.\n\nYet despite this long history of hunger strikes, U.S. law remains unclear on whether jailors may forcibly feed prisoners. The U.S. Supreme Court has never directly addressed the issue and lower courts are divided on the question.\n\nIn this column, I consider the legality of forced feeding of Guantanamo Bay detainees. Although I conclude that the policy probably will not be blocked by the courts, it is nonetheless deeply troubling.\n\nUnder the law of every state in the United States, competent adults have the right to refuse medical treatment and that right has generally been construed to include a right to refuse food and water. But the Guantanamo prison is run by the federal government, which is not subject to state laws. It is subject to the Constitution, though, and in the 1990 case of Cruzan v. Dir., Missouri Dep\u2019t of Health, the Supreme Court assumed that a competent adult does have the right to refuse food and water. That case did not exactly decide the current issue, however, because it involved the disconnection of a feeding tube from a woman who was no longer competent and whose wishes were contested.\n\nStill, five Justices in the Cruzan case did say that they thought that competent adults have the right to refuse forced feeding, even if death will result. That looks like a solid legal foundation for the detainees who are resisting forced feeding.\n\nBut Cruzan is not the only relevant precedent. Prisoners, and even pre-trial detainees who have not been found guilty of any offense, generally have fewer rights than persons at large. In recognition that judges lack the relevant institutional expertise, they give considerable deference to prison and jail administrators, even when the contested policies infringe constitutional rights.\n\nThus, in another 1990 case\u2014Washington v. Harper\u2014the Supreme Court held that prison officials were entitled to override a prisoner\u2019s objection to forcibly being administered medication, even without a determination that the prisoner was incompetent and thus unable to decide for himself. The Court in Harper assumed that prison psychiatrists would only forcibly medicate a prisoner if doing so is in his medical interest.\n\nHarper strongly suggests that prisoner and detainee claims against forced feeding would likely fail if brought before the Supreme Court. After all, the medical case for forced feeding of at least some hunger strikers is stronger than the medical case for involuntary psychiatric medicine. One might think that the prison doctors in Harper were simply interested in rendering prisoners docile, whereas there is little doubt that prisoners will eventually die if they fail to eat. Although lower courts have sometimes held that prison officials may not forcibly feed a prisoner at the beginning of a hunger strike, Harper does appear to validate the current stated policy at Guantanamo Bay, whereby detainees are forcibly fed when they become dangerously weak.\n\nAlthough the right against the forcible administration of medication may prove unavailing to the detainees, they have other possible arguments. In domestic cases, prisoners have sometimes claimed protection for hunger strikes as a form of free speech.\n\nYet those cases typically fail. Even though hunger strikers refuse to eat as a form of expressive conduct, the First Amendment does not protect otherwise proscribable conduct simply because someone engages in it to prove a point.\n\nTo be sure, if prisoners can successfully show that the authorities are forcibly feeding them in retaliation for their protest, they may be able to win their free speech claim. But such a showing will be difficult to make. When challenged, the Guantanamo Bay prison authorities cite concerns, such as prisoner health, that are unrelated to the ideas expressed by the hunger strikers.\n\nAnother potential avenue of attack may be freedom of religion. The First Amendment is no more helpful to the detainees\u2019 case with respect to religion than with respect to speech: So long as the government does not target hunger strikers because of their expressive or religious motive, the government may pursue its otherwise permissible objectives.\n\nHowever, a federal statute, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) forbids the federal government from imposing excessive burdens on religious exercise, even if the burdens at issue are not specifically targeted at religion. Although RFRA was held unconstitutional as applied to state and local governments in the 1997 case of City of Boerne v. Flores, it remains valid as applied to the federal government.\n\nNonetheless, the Guantanamo Bay detainees are unlikely to prevail under RFRA, for two reasons. First, it is not at all clear that forcibly feeding hunger strikers burdens their religion at all. True, the original impetus for the current hunger strike was the perception of the disrespectful treatment of a Koran, but it is difficult to show that requiring the detainees to eat would in any way violate their religious tenets.\n\nSecond, even if the detainees could claim that forced feeding burdens their religious practice under RFRA, the courts have applied RFRA in the prison context with the same deference to prison authorities that they have given those same authorities under the free exercise clause of the First Amendment. Hence, a religious freedom claim appears likely to fail.\n\nThe detainees\u2019 best argument may be that forced feeding violates international law, as argued in a 2006 report by the United Nation Commission on Human Rights. That report cited three grounds for deeming the forced feeding of hunger-striking Guantanamo Bay prisoners illegal: First, it violates an international law principle of autonomy that is roughly parallel to the principle at stake in the Cruzan case; second, certain methods of forced feeding amount to torture; and third, the participation of doctors in forced feeding violates medical ethics and international law principles.\n\nIn public statements made both when the report was initially released and since, the U.S. government has defended forced feeding as a humane, and thus legal, alternative to permitting detainees to starve themselves. At the very least, there appears to be a genuine division of opinion over whether international law forbids the forced feeding of hunger-striking prisoners.\n\nIn these circumstances, it is highly unlikely that the U.S. courts would grant relief based on international law. None of the relevant international treaties forbids forced feeding expressly, and even if one did, the Roberts Court would likely find that the treaty language is not self-executing\u2014that is, the Court would likely find that the treaty language requires implementing legislation, which Congress has not enacted. Meanwhile, it appears even less likely that the U.S. courts would find that customary international law gives rise to a judicially enforceable right against forced feeding.\n\nIndeed, most of the Guantanamo Bay detainees may find that they cannot litigate any claims challenging forced feeding. A Bush-era statute both forbids detainees from bringing claims based on the Geneva Conventions, and strips the civilian courts of all jurisdiction to entertain any challenge to \u201cany aspect of the . . . treatment . . . or conditions of confinement of an alien who is or was detained by the United States and has been determined by the United States to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination.\u201d\n\nAlthough that statute was the basis for the dismissal of a suit challenging the forced feeding of hunger strikers in the 2009 district court ruling in Al-Adahi v. Obama, the last statutory qualifier does appear to open a small loophole: Some of the detainees now hunger-striking have been determined not to be enemy combatants but continue to be held anyway because of the government\u2019s inability to find a place to send them, as I noted above. These detainees would appear to fall outside of the statutory exclusion, and thus could bring a civilian lawsuit contesting the conditions of their confinement.\n\nEven then, such plaintiffs would face two very substantial obstacles were they to go to court. First, as we have seen above, the available legal claims seem likely to fail on the merits.\n\nSecond, even though the cleared detainees would not be barred from suing by the statutory language quoted above, they would still need to demonstrate that they had a right to sue. Yet, as I explained in a column last year, the current Supreme Court has been closing the door to civil rights litigation in recent years. The days are long gone when anyone with a colorable claim that his civil rights had been violated could at least expect his day in court.\n\nHence, the Obama Administration\u2019s lawyers appear to have done their homework. The odds that the forced-feeding policy will be struck down are slim.\n\nInsulation from judicial review is not vindication, however. The Administration faces a true dilemma in the detainee hunger strike. Either course\u2014permitting the detainees to starve, or forcibly feeding them\u2014is a humanitarian and a public relations disaster.\n\nPresident Obama recently revived his goal of closing the Guantanamo Bay prison, which is laudable but not sufficient to address the underlying problem. Merely relocating Guantanamo\u2019s prisoners to some other location would change little.\n\nAs my fellow Verdict columnist John Dean noted in a recent column describing the Constitution Project report on American detention policy since 9/11, that policy has been deeply flawed from the outset. In particular, the relevant portion of the report tends to confirm that military officials at Guantanamo Bay have used excessive force against hunger strikers.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s foreign policy has been slowly unwinding the Bush Administration\u2019s misadventures in Iraq and Afghanistan. The time is long overdue to completely rethink detention policy as well.",

But we are comforted by the memory of his long, full and inspiring life and so proud of his devotion to helping others as he sought to change the world for the better. Arrangements for his funeral will be announced in due course.\"\n\nBorn Anthony Neil Wedgwood Benn, he entered parliament in 1950 as MP for Bristol South East, becoming the youngest member of the house at the age of 25.\n\nHe had to leave the Commons a decade later, as the death of his father, a Labour peer, meant he inherited the title of Viscount Stansgate. However, he campaigned for a change in the law and returned to his seat three years later after renouncing the title.\n\nDuring his 50-year parliamentary career, Benn served as minister for technology, industry and energy under Harold Wilson and James Callaghan. He also campaigned against EU membership and oversaw the development of Concorde.\n\nAfter a successful cabinet career under Wilson in the 70s, he swung to the left politically and challenged Denis Healey for the Labour deputy leadership \u2013 only losing by the narrowest of margins after one of the key unions switched sides at the last minute.\n\nHe then became instrumental in using Labour party machinery to develop a leftwing manifesto on which Michael Foot fought the 1983 election.\n\nHe was also central to the campaign to make Labour MPs more accountable to their constituencies through automatic re-selection, a reform hated by many Labour MPs at the time but now regarded as wholly uncontroversial.\n\nAfter Foot's defeat and the emergence of Neil Kinnock as party leader in 1983, the party shifted to the centre, and Benn began to lose his direct political influence over the party. He was heavily defeated when he stood against Kinnock for the party leadership in 1988 and left parliament in 2001, after the first term of the Blair government, to \"spend more time on politics\".\n\nFrom there on his influence tended to emerge through his thinking, diaries, oratory and latterly appearances at literary festivals and political rallies.\n\nHe became known for his campaign against the invasion of Iraq, addressing the UK's biggest ever demonstration during the Stop the War rally of 2003.\n\nEd Miliband, the Labour leader, said: \"The death of Tony Benn represents the loss of an iconic figure of our age. He will be remembered as a champion of the powerless, a great parliamentarian and a conviction politician.\n\n\"Tony Benn spoke his mind and spoke up for his values. Whether you agreed with him or disagreed with him, everyone knew where he stood and what he stood for.\n\n\"For someone of such strong views, often at odds with his party, he won respect from across the political spectrum.\n\n\"This was because of his unshakeable beliefs and his abiding determination that power and the powerful should be held to account.\"\n\nMiliband said he had done work experience with Benn at the age of 16. \"I may have been just a teenager but he treated me as an equal,\" the Labour leader said.\n\nMargaret Beckett, a contemporary during some of the most bitter Labour infighting in the 80s said: \"He was an absolutely brilliant speaker ... he had such clarity of expression.\" She added that he was \"a charming, nice man. He made enemies and kept enemies but on the whole most people regarded him with a good degree of affection long before it came to the stage when it was thought he could cause no harm. He was out of step for many years with whoever was in the charge of the leadership. He wanted to make people think and that was an admirable thing.\"\n\nDavid Cameron \u2013 who once said he had been strongly influenced by Benn's book Arguments for Democracy \u2013 tweeted: \"Tony Benn was a magnificent writer, speaker and campaigner. There was never a dull moment listening to him, even if you disagreed with him.\"\n\nThe former Labour cabinet minister Peter Hain said: \"Tony Benn was a giant of socialism who encouraged me to join Labour in 1977: wonderful inspirational speaker and person: will be deeply missed.\"\n\nThe Labour MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, Diane Abbott, also paid tribute to Benn. \"Admired so many things about Benn,\" she said. \"Unwavering principles; always open to new ideas; stellar political speaker but unfailingly courteous.\"\n\nShami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty, said: \"In the final decade of an extraordinary political life, Tony Benn was a great friend of Liberty and human rights. He spoke to packed audiences up and down the country against internment and identity cards and for values of internationalism and humanity. And he often shared the stage with speakers of different political stripes with considerable generosity. I shall never forget his many kindnesses to me, including when he ripped up a prepared speech he was about to deliver, in order to make my own nervous and novice remarks sound slightly less unplanned. In an age of spin, he was solid, a signpost and not a weathervane.\"\n\nBenn was a divisive figure within the Labour party because of his steadfast support for traditional socialism. His son Hilary, the Labour MP for Leeds Central and shadow secretary of state for communities and local government, famously described himself as \"a Benn, not a Bennite\". The Sun once asked whether his firebrand views made him \"the most dangerous man in Britain\".\n\nSome old ministerial colleagues from the 1970s and 80s privately made plain they would be making no public comment, reluctant to speak ill of the dead. But bitterness against what they still see as his destructive and dishonest conduct during the Bennite ascendancy remains toxic.\n\nHis death prompted tributes from many Eurosceptic MPs who remembered his longstanding opposition to the European Union.\n\nBenn had suffered from ill health since a stroke in 2012, spending much of the subsequent year in hospital. In an interview with the Daily Mirror last year, he said he was not frightened about death. \"I don't know why, but I just feel that at a certain moment your switch is switched off and that's it. And you can't do anything about it,\" he said.\n\nBenn was admitted to hospital again in September last year on the advice of his GP after feeling unwell and had recently moved to sheltered accommodation near his Holland Park home in west London.\n\nOutside his home in his garden stands the bench on which he proposed to Caroline, the wife he was devoted to and whom he missed grievously after her death. He is survived by their four children, Stephen, Hilary, Melissa and Joshua.",

Definitely, the weather added to the mix. The whole session went well,\" Ricciardo told a media gathering.\n\n\"When the rain fell, I think it was ... the first time we've all really driven these cars in the wet conditions. It was tricky but at the same time a lot of fun.\n\n\"It's nice to be always up there. The engineer was on the radio saying 'pace is good' ... and it was always in that battle for pole position. A really nice first qualifying session with the team.\n\nWhile he did not know what problems affected team-mate Vettel, Ricciardo said he was pleased for Red Bull to have at least one starter in the front row.\n\n\"I don't know yet, I don't know what his issues were,\" Ricciardo said.\n\n\"I think I saw it was about two seconds off my pace. We'll have to see what went wrong with Seb and his side of the garage.\n\n\"But for now I'm happy for me to be up here and for the team to have a front-row start. It wasn't looking like this a few weeks ago, so I'm pretty pleased right now.\"\n\nIt was the first time Vettel had failed to make the final round of qualifying since he started 11th on the grid in Belgium in 2012, before battling through the field to finish the race second.\n\nThe 26-year-old German was in esteemed company, with two other champions - McLaren's Jenson Button and Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen - also failing to get into the final group of 10. Button qualified 11th.\n\nRaikkonen, the 2007 world champion, was 12th fastest in his first race since returning to Maranello after crashing into the wall at turn 14.\n\nTop speedster Hamilton saved the best for last with his final lap after Ricciardo had topped the timesheets only seconds earlier on his first race weekend for champions Red Bull.\n\nThe 29-year-old Briton's time of one minute 44.231 seconds on a wet Albert Park track was just over three-tenths of a second faster than Ricciardo, who upstaged quadruple world champion team mate Sebastian Vettel to delight the home fans.\n\n\"Today made it so much harder with the conditions, but I'm really happy with the job the team did,\" said Hamilton.\n\n\"These cars are much harder driving in the wet.\"\n\nMercedes' Rosberg will start third on the grid alongside McLaren's 21-year-old Danish rookie Kevin Magnussen, who underlined his talent with a poised drive in trying conditions.\n\nFerrari's Fernando Alonso qualified fifth with Jean-Eric Vergne sixth fastest for Toro Rosso.\n\nLotus's horror week continued as both Frenchman Romain Grosjean and Venezuelan Pastor Maldonado were among the six slowest failing to make it through the first round of qualifying.\n\nGrosjean locked up and spun off after posting the slowest lap time in the opening session, while Maldonado was unable even to trouble the timesheets.\n\nSauber's Mexican Esteban Gutierrez, who qualified 19th, also collected a five-place grid penalty for the race for having a new gearbox.",

But at the same time still saying calm and collected because tomorrow is what counts,\" the 24-year-old told reporters.\n\n\"There is no point having a party tonight and not focusing on tomorrow.\"\n\nRicciardo held pole position with just 15 seconds remaining of qualifying, only for a flying Hamilton to pinch top-billing with a dramatic last-gasp surge.\n\nHamilton's Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg will start from third spot but Ricciardo's Red Bull Racing colleague, four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, bombed.\n\nVettel didn't even make the final cut in the three-phases of qualifying and will start from 12th position.\n\n\"I struggled for driveability, for control,\" Vettel said.\n\n\"For some reason, we have lost that overnight so we need to understand why that happened.\"\n\nRicciardo had no such questions after taming his new V6 beast in the rain.\n\n\"We were all figuring how difficult these new animals would be in wet conditions,\" he said.\n\n\"It was always a bit of a handful, but at the same time quite nice behind the wheel.\n\n\"Obviously the wet throws a bit of a curve ball. You have just got to take it as it comes and see how you go ... there wasn't too much calculating going on in my head.\"\n\nBut the Red Bull Racing newcomer said he would temper his excitement at his stunning qualifying feats.\n\n\"It's cool. But I won't get ahead of myself,\" he said.\n\n\"I have still got a bit to prove and establish myself up the front ... this is definitely a step towards that and I'll give it a good crack.\"\n\nRicciardo clocked 1m44.458s in the last qualifying phase - some 14 seconds behind his time in the initial phase before the rain lashed the circuit.\n\nHamilton was 0.317s quicker in the final phase to equal British compatriot Nigel Mansell's record of 32 career poles.\n\n\"The rain made it so much harder for everyone but I'm really happy,\" Hamilton said.\n\n\"It was a serious task and challenge.\"",

His wife, Shona, and children Callum and Fiona, had expected him home later that day.\n\nAlthough a \u201croutine\u201d flight, it ended in tragedy with all 14 oil workers and two crew killed.\n\nDays before the flight there had been a problem with the gearbox but it had not been replaced because of a series of verbal and email misunderstandings with the manufacturer.\n\nYesterday, Sheriff Principal Derek Pyle, published the findings of the fatal accident inquiry held during January and February in Aberdeen Townhouse, in which evidence was given by owners of the Supa Puma G-REDL, Bond Offshore Helicopters Limited, manufacturers Eurocopter, as well as crash investigators.\n\nHe found that Mr Rae died from \u201cmultiple injuries\u201d sustained during the crash.\n\nThe sheriff principal said \u201cthe pattern of injury was entirely consistent with the circumstances and death would have been instantaneous\u201d.\n\nIn keeping with an earlier Air Accidents Investigation branch report, he also found that the cause of the accident was the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d failure of the main rotor gearbox. This was a result of a \u201cfatigue fracture\u201d.\n\nThe FAI found that, on that fateful day, co-pilot Richard Menzies had told air traffic control at Aberdeen Airport to expect them in 20 minutes but six seconds later an oil warning light came on, followed by a \u201cgrinding\u201d noise.\n\nTwo mayday calls were made but it was too late: the main rotor broke away and severed the tail boom, sending the fuselage into a \u201crapid descent into the sea.\u201d\n\nIt had all taken just 20 seconds.\n\nSheriff Principal Pyle found that Bond failed to follow correct procedure and the aircraft maintenance manual.\n\nHe said it was \u201cpossible\u201d that if the failures had not occurred \u201cthe accident might have been avoided\u201d.\n\nIn his report, he said there was a \u201claxity in following correct procedures in dealing with Eurocopter \u2013 and undoubtedly that should not have happened.\n\n\u201cThe essential fact is that everyone in the company well knew that maintenance must be done by the book.\n\n\u201cOn one occasion that fundamental rule was broken. It resulted in the failure to detect a significant fault in the helicopters gearbox, which possibly \u2013 only possibly \u2013 resulted in the crash.\u201d\n\nIn a statement yesterday, Bond Offshore Helicopters said: \u201cWe have always accepted that we made mistakes through honest confusion over telephone calls and emails. Lessons needed to be learned, lessons have been learned and lessons continue to be learned.\u201d\n\nThe sheriff principal had praised the \u201ccourage\u201d of the families during the FAI.\n\nThey now want a criminal inquiry, despite the Crown Office saying there was \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d for a prosecution last year.",

                "text": "Relatives of 16 men killed in a Super Puma helicopter crash in the North Sea have criticised the \"intolerable\" five-year wait for the findings of a judge-led inquiry into the tragedy.\n\nAudrey Wood, whose son Stuart was one of those killed when the helicopter crashed in 2009, said all the families felt let down by the system after a fatal accident inquiry (FAI) ruled that the crash could have been prevented.\n\nSheriff Principal Derek Pyle said he believed several failures by the helicopter's operators, Bond Offshore Helicopters, to properly deal with metal particles found in the engine during routine checks could have led to the crash.\n\nThe Super Puma plunged into the North Sea about 11 miles off Peterhead on 1 April 2009, during clear, calm and sunny conditions, after a catastrophic gearbox failure. The two crew and 14 oil workers were killed almost instantaneously by the force of the impact, Pyle found.\n\nWood said the relatives were surprised and disappointed to hear the Crown Office again insist there was not enough evidence to justify a criminal investigation against Bond Offshore Helicopters for repeated breaches of health and safety rules.\n\n\"How they arrived at that decision will haunt us, as not only did we hear of multiple breaches of health and safety, but the decision was also made without all the evidence being present, as vital witness statements had not been given,\" Wood said.\n\n\"Safety must be paramount and everything must be done by the book. There can be no excuse for not doing this. The length of wait for nearly five years has been intolerable for all the families and we, the families, feel let down by the system.\"\n\nTheir complaints were supported by the Scottish TUC and Scottish Labour MSPs, who demanded an overhaul of the FAI system set out in a bill from Labour MSP Patricia Ferguson at Holyrood. The Scottish government said it needed to consider Pyle's findings.\n\nGrahame Smith, the STUC's general secretary, said that since the FAI system was designed to investigate the causes of fatal accidents, a five-year delay was an unacceptably long time.\n\n\"It is vitally important that lessons are learned at the earliest opportunity following tragedies where lives are lost and any recommendations put in place to avoid further needless loss of life,\" he said.\n\nRichard Baker MSP said: \"Nearly five years is far too long for families to have to wait for these conclusions to be drawn, not to mention the many other people who travel to work by helicopter in the North Sea. FAIs should never be delayed so long again.\"\n\nPyle found all 16 passengers and crew were killed by multiple injuries. For eight of the victims, \"the indications were that the death was as a result of sudden deceleration and blunt force impact and there was nothing to suggest survival with subsequent drowning,\" the sheriff said. The other eight died \"instantaneously\" from the force of the crash.\n\nIn his detailed decision following six weeks of hearings, Pyle said it was possible the accident was caused because Bond personnel had failed to carry out a series of tasks, but he could not be certain.\n\nThey did not remove a piece of machinery known as the epicyclic module after a metal particle was found, which suggested metal particles were shearing off in the engine. They failed to follow the correct communication procedures with the aircraft's manufacturer, Eurocopter, and failed to identify the type of metal in the particle.\n\nHe concluded: \"The cause of the accident which resulted in said deaths was the catastrophic failure of the main rotor gearbox of the said helicopter on the said date, which was as a result of a fatigue fracture of a second stage planet gear in the epicyclic module and which caused the helicopter to descend into the sea.\"\n\nAfter the FAI heard detailed evidence about maintenance failures by Bond, the firm admitted it had made a series of \"honest\" mistakes. \"We have always accepted that we made mistakes through honest confusion over telephone calls and emails,\" the firm said, in a statement.\n\n\"Lessons needed to be learned, lessons have been learned and lessons continue to be learned. We would like to express again our deep sorrow at the 16 lives lost.\"\n\nThe Crown Office said it sympathised with the relatives' over their wait, but insisted that the case was complex and there had already been police, Air Accident Investigation Branch and Civil Aviation Authority inquiries.\n\nAnd in the new ruling, the sheriff confirmed there was still doubt over the precise technical cause of the crash. \"For a criminal prosecution to have taken place, the Crown would have to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The sheriff principal makes clear that a reasonable doubt remained over the technical cause of the crash,\" the Crown Office said.\n\n\"The evidence presented during the FAI has not altered the insufficiency of evidence therefore the decision not to hold criminal proceedings remains the correct one.\"\n\nJim McAuslan, general secretary of the airline pilots union Balpa, said the sheriff's findings, which endorsed the findings of the Air Accident Investigation Branch, proved that \"maintenance must never be treated lightly\".\n\n\"The operator's maintenance failures, which have been drawn out in both the AAIB report and today's FAI report, are the main lesson for the industry,\" he said.\n\nThe two Bond crew members who died were Capt Paul Burnham, 31, from Aberdeenshire, and co-pilot Richard Menzies, 24, of Droitwich Spa.\n\nThe 14 civilians killed were Brian Barkley, 30, of Aberdeen, Vernon Elrick, 41, of Aberdeen, Leslie Taylor, 41, of Kintore, Aberdeenshire, Nairn Ferrier, 40, of Dundee, Gareth Hughes, 53, of Angus, David Rae, 63, of Dumfries, Raymond Doyle, 57, of Cumbernauld, James John Edwards, 33, of Liverpool, Nolan Goble, 34, of Norwich, and Mihails Zuravskis, 39, of Latvia, all employees of the contractor KCA Deutag.\n\nThe other victims were James Costello, 24, of Aberdeen, who was working for Production Services Network, Alex Dallas, 62, of Aberdeen, who worked for Sparrows Offshore Services, Warren Mitchell, 38, of Oldmeldrum, Aberdeenshire, who worked for Weatherford UK, and Stuart Wood, 27, of Aberdeen, who worked for Expro North Sea Ltd.",

                "text": "TODAY, Sheriff Principal Derek C Pyle released his determination after hearing all the evidence at the Fatal Accident Inquiry into the death of 14 oil workers and two helicopter pilots.\n\nSixteen people were killed when the Super Puma crashed into the North Sea on Wednesday, April 1, 2009.\n\nThese are his findings:\n\n\u201cThe fact that the investigation took some 30 months is testimony to its thoroughness. No party questioned the technical data. The report describes most of the relevant facts which might otherwise be set out by me as findings in fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs in any tragedy, the world has a habit of moving on. But that is not an option for those left to cope with the sudden loss of loved ones. No-one could not be moved by the courage of many members of the victims\u2019 families who sat through every day of the inquiry. Indeed, there was a poignant moment when a witness was being taken through the graph in the AAIB report which set out the timeline of the accident that I, if not others present, understood for the first time the true horror of what took place.\u201d\n\n\u201cShortly before the accident Bond maintenance employees were responsible for a number of admitted failures correctly to perform maintenance on G-REDL helicopter. The starting point in considering the cause or causes of the subsequent accident might be that it would be an extraordinary coincidence if the failure properly to carry out inspection and maintenance of the helicopter\u2019s gearbox was not causative of a catastrophic failure of the same within a matter of days. But, as the evidence made clear, such a coincidence was indeed a possibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe difficulty in this case was that the small piece of the helicopter which would have proved the matter beyond any doubt had not been recovered from the seabed and they therefore had no choice but to draw conclusions as best as they could from the imperfect evidence before them.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, on the balance of probabilities the conclusion reached by Dr Mermoz ought to be preferred. It was agreed by them both that spalling [\u2019rolling contact fatigue\u2019] is the most common cause of damage to helicopter gearboxes. In contrast, material defect is rare\u2026 Accordingly, for the reasons I have given I hold on the balance of probabilities that the cause of the accident was spalling and not material defect.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was not disputed by any witness at the inquiry that the primary means of ensuring that spalling does not result in gearbox failure is through regular maintenance\u2026 During the course of the inquiry there was much discussion about the circumstances which led Bond not to follow the clear terms of the maintenance manual.... Bond readily acknowledged that they ought to have done so\u2026. On many occasions during the inquiry it was acknowledged that the primary rule throughout the industry is that everything must be done by the book - that is to say, in accordance with the maintenance manual. There can therefore be no excuse for not doing so.\n\n\u201cI considered that they all had tried to carry out their jobs as diligently as they could. All of them impressed me as engineers who well understood the vital importance of their role in ensuring the safety of the pilots and passengers who used the company\u2019s aircraft. Nor did I detect that there was a culture within the company of not taking training seriously or that the staff had insufficient resources to perform their functions properly. That was the view of the AAIB and the Civil Aviation Authority inspectors. It is certainly true that there was a laxity in following the correct procedures in dealings with Eurocopter - and undoubtedly that should not have happened. But I am not prepared to conclude from that failure that there were systemic defects in the remainder of the maintenance procedures and their implementation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe crash of G-REDL was a tragedy. Coupled with the other helicopter accidents in Scotland over the recent past, it has raised fundamental questions about the safety of helicopters, not least in the oil and gas industry of the North Sea. It cost the lives of 16 men. It has caused considerable public interest. It is therefore particularly important that whatever lessons can be learned from it are properly identified and acted upon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will question later whether it should always be that regarding regular maintenance as the principal means of ensuring the safety of helicopters is correct, but in the present context I consider that steps should be taken by Eurocopter in discussion with the CAA and EASA to consider whether the other methods of oil analysis should be applied to Super Puma helicopters.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe helicopter industry as a whole must also be reminded that its primary responsibility is the safety of its passengers and crews. Indeed, to compromise on that responsibility can potentially be self-defeating in purely economic terms as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat can, I think, very properly be said is that nearly five years is on any view far too long and that we all have a responsibility for that. And that everyone concerned in future fatal accidents involving aircraft of whatever kind should do much better.\u201d",

                "text": "UNDER THE FATAL ACCIDENTS AND SUDDEN DEATHS INQUIRY (SCOTLAND) ACT 1976\n\nIN THE SHERIFFDOM OF GRAMPIAN, HIGHLAND AND ISLANDS AT ABERDEEN\n\nINTO THE DEATHS OF JOHN BRIAN HUGH BARKLEY, PAUL STEPHEN BURNHAM, JAMES ANTAL REAMONN STEPHEN COSTELLO, ALEXANDER GORDON DALLAS, RAYMOND STEELE DOYLE, JAMES JOHN EDWARDS, VERNON JOHN ELRICK, NAIRN JAMES FERRIER, NOLAN CARL GOBLE, GARETH WYN HUGHES, RICHARD ANTHONY MENZIES, WARREN GEORGE MITCHELL, DAVID JOHN RAE, LESLIE STANLEY TAYLOR, STUART LEE WOOD AND MIHAILS ZURAVSKIS\n\n[1] During the early afternoon of Wednesday 1 April 2009, a Super Puma helicopter, registration G-REDL, owned by Bond Offshore Helicopters Limited, was flying over the North Sea, en route from the Miller Oil Platform to Aberdeen. It was a routine flight, one which is done on numerous occasions each day to ferry workers to and from the North Sea oil fields. The weather was clear and sunny and the sea was calm. On board was the pilot, Paul Burnham. He was 31 years of age. He was assisted by his co-pilot, Richard Menzies. He was 24. They were responsible for the 14 passengers on board. They all worked on the platform. The youngest, James Costello, was 24; the oldest, David Rae, was 63. All, bar three, lived in Aberdeen or elsewhere in Scotland. Two, James Edwards and Nolan Goble, lived in England. One, Mihails Zuravskis, came from Riga in Latvia.\n\n[2] At 1.54 pm, Mr Menzies contacted Air Traffic Control at Aberdeen Airport to advise that they expected to arrive there in 20 minutes. Six seconds later, a warning appeared on the helicopter's flight deck indicating low oil pressure in the main gearbox. This was immediately followed by a grinding noise which lasted for four seconds. It was accompanied by a sudden increase in airspeed from 140 to 170 knots and a sudden increase in pressure altitude. Six seconds later, Mr Burnham issued a mayday call, which was followed by a further one five seconds later by Mr Menzies.\n\n[3] The grinding noise which the pilots had heard was the beginning of the break-up of the main gearbox which was attached to the main rotor. Twenty seconds after the appearance of the oil warning light the main rotor broke away and then severed the tail boom in a series of strikes. The fuselage began a rapid descent into the sea.\n\n[4] At that time, Lidvar Hildre, a ship's mechanic on a platform supply ship, the Normand Aurora, was painting a cargo rail. As he looked out on the starboard side he suddenly saw about two nautical miles away a helicopter falling into the sea. There was a large splash followed by a bang and white smoke. He then saw four rotor blades all attached together falling out of the sky and hitting the sea close to where the helicopter was. Captain Arne Lystad immediately gave the order to launch the fast rescue boat, as the ship itself turned to go full speed to the crash site. By this time, Her Majesty's Coastguard had launched a major search and rescue operation which involved five aircraft, including helicopters and an RAF Nimrod. Ten vessels responded to a request to assist in the search.\n\n[6] By 6 April, all the bodies and the remains of the helicopter had been recovered and taken to Aberdeen.\n\n[7] Before considering the extensive evidence led in this inquiry, I will make some general observations which will explain my approach in reaching my determination.\n\n1. It is important to explain the purposes of a fatal accident inquiry. They are set out in the Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1976. The application for such an inquiry is made to the sheriff by the Lord Advocate who decides whether the inquiry should be held. In doing so, he is acting in the public interest. That is what happened in this case. My responsibility as Sheriff Principal is to make a determination at the conclusion of the evidence setting out the following circumstances of the deaths so far as they have been established to my satisfaction:\n\n(1) where and when the accident resulting in the deaths took place;\n\n(2) the cause or causes of the accident;\n\n(3) the reasonable precautions, if any, whereby the accident might have been avoided;\n\n(4) the defects, if any, in any system of working which contributed to the accident; and\n\n(5) any other facts which are relevant in the circumstances of the deaths.\n\n2. It is often said (and was said by me on more than one occasion during the inquiry) that it is not the purpose of a fatal accident inquiry to establish fault. The reasons for that approach in its historical context are helpfully set out in the definitive textbook, Carmichael, Sudden Deaths and Fatal Accident Inquiries. But it does not represent the whole picture. In the same text, the following observation is made:\n\n\"Be it noted that, although the findings required of a sheriff under the 1976 Act are depersonalised in respect that he has no power to name a person or persons, if any, to whose fault and negligence the accident is attributable, this does not mean that the evidence led at an inquiry may not disclose fault. In that event, a finding implying or imputing fault is competent. In addition, where the evidence is sufficiently compelling, the responsibility of exposing and finding fault should be accepted. The whole object of impartial public inquiry is to get at the truth, to expose fault where fault is proven to exist, and in all cases to see to it so far as humanly possible that the same mistake, whether it arise through fault or any other reason, is not made in the future. The public interest, in whose names inquiries are held, requires and deserves no less.\"\n\nThus my approach has been that it is not my role to search for fault; but in the event that I find it I should not hesitate to express it.\n\n3. There are two primary purposes of a fatal accident inquiry, apart from the formal one of where and when a death took place:\n\nFirst, it is an opportunity for the whole circumstances of an accident to be aired in public. Witnesses are examined and cross-examined under oath and documents are considered and scrutinised. Any party interested in the circumstances is free to come to his or her own conclusions on the evidence.\n\nSecondly, it is an opportunity for an independent judge to come to his or her own conclusions on the evidence and to present them in the form of findings in a determination. But the determination is not the same as a judgment delivered at the end of a civil proof or a criminal trial. It has no consequences. A judgment at the end of a proof might result in an order for the payment of damages by one party to another, in the form of a decree which the law will enforce. A criminal trial might result in a finding of guilt which in turn will lead to the court imposing a penalty which, again, the law will enforce. In contrast, a determination at the end of a fatal accident inquiry has no legal effect. If the court decides upon the cause of the death, any party can ignore it and continue to maintain that the death was caused by something else. If the court makes a recommendation for future action, the party burdened with implementing it is free to disagree and do nothing. After a civil proof it is customary for the court to deal with all the facts and circumstances, decide what facts are proved, apply the law to those facts and then reach a final decision. The judgment will be a comprehensive document. But that is not necessarily the correct approach in a fatal accident inquiry. Given that one of its purposes is to allow interested parties to hear the evidence, there will be occasions when there is no purpose in the court reaching any formal conclusions upon all of it. That is the approach which I have adopted. In particular, I have not followed the usual practice (and one which I have always followed on previous occasions when presiding in fatal accident inquiries) of setting out my conclusions on the evidence by way of findings in fact. I have not done so for three reasons:\n\n1. The speciality of accidents in the air is that a full investigation is always carried out by the Air Accident Investigation Branch (\"AAIB\") of the Department of Transport. That is what happened in this case. The AAIB report was published in October 2011. It is an impressive document which extends to 114 pages and ten appendices. It may well be that the fact that the investigation took some 30 months is testimony to its thoroughness. No party questioned the technical data. The report describes most of the relevant facts which might otherwise be set out by me as findings in fact. It has been seen and doubtless read by all the parties with an interest. Any attempt by me to reduce it to findings in fact would do a discourtesy to the careful work of the inspectors who are plainly experts in their respective fields and, more importantly, it runs the risk of a lawyer's use of language inaccurately describing what is already correctly and comprehensively set out by skilled engineers. More prosaically, to reduce all of the evidence to findings in fact would mean that they would be in the hundreds, if not the thousands. I do not think that would assist understanding.\n\n2. Equally importantly - perhaps more so - this inquiry was established in the public interest. The public is not made up exclusively of aeronautical engineers. My determination, so far as is possible in the face of evidence which was both complex and very technical, should try to inform the public as a whole about the circumstances of the accident. Neither is the public made up exclusively of lawyers. There is a danger that findings in fact, the idea of which is readily familiar to litigation lawyers and judges, would obscure, rather than assist, a proper understanding of the facts and the conclusions to be drawn from those facts.\n\n3. But there is also a human aspect to this matter. I have set out in the introduction how the accident occurred. In doing so, I have avoided technical language. I have also attempted, I hope sensitively, to express in a narrative style how this accident is likely to be remembered by the victims' families and others close to them. As in any tragedy, the world has a habit of moving on. But that is not an option for those left to cope with the sudden loss of loved ones. No-one could not be moved by the courage of many members of the victims' families who sat through every day of the inquiry. Indeed, there was a poignant moment when a witness was being taken through the graph in the AAIB report which set out the timeline of the accident that I, if not others present, understood for the first time the true horror of what took place. It is important for us all that this sense is not lost in the technical language in which of necessity the evidence must be expressed. In avoiding formal findings in fact, I have endeavoured to express the technical evidence, insofar as it is discussed, in language which while still technically accurate will nevertheless inform the members of the public who are neither engineers nor lawyers about what happened and the lessons to be learned. In doing so, I hope, however inadequately, to pay proper respect to the honour of the victims and those who are most closely affected by their loss.\n\nBut there is a further consequence caused by the nature of fatal accident inquiries. I do not intend to deal with every aspect of the evidence; nor do I intend to discuss in detail every point made in the parties' submissions, particularly those made by Mr Marshall for the families. For some of the points, I simply do not accept that there has been sufficient evidence led at the inquiry. For others, I consider that they would detract from the principal issues which ought properly be discussed and determined upon. That is not meant as a discourtesy; instead it is out of a desire to address what Mr Marshall identified as the principal questions which the families, and probably others, want answered. These are, first, why did the accident happen and, secondly, what has been done and, if appropriate, what more can be done to avoid such an accident happening again. Thus, this determination does not seek to be a comprehensive - and probably unwieldy - document setting out the whole facts and circumstances, the arguments for and against the propositions put and my decision on each of them. Any party interested in the accident should therefore look at the AAIB report, the other productions and, where appropriate, the transcript of the evidence. This determination will, I hope, answer the main questions, but the answers to any others will likely be found in the whole inquiry papers.\n\n[8] Before turning to the discrete matters which I am required to address, I wish to comment briefly upon two further matters:\n\nThe first is the scope of the particular evidence allowed in the inquiry. Mr Marshall is a hugely experienced solicitor. It was obvious to me that he had prepared his case with his customary diligence. His mastery of technical detail was outstanding. During the course of his cross-examination of each witness, he probed with great skill to ensure that I was fully informed of all and any relevant facts and circumstances. On occasion, others represented at the inquiry unsuccessfully sought to restrict his questions. But there were occasions when they were successful. I will not go over again what I said when such objections were made, but it might be helpful to Mr Marshall's clients if I explain my broad approach on this matter. I have already set out the statutory scope of the inquiry; it can include matters such as the overall performance of the company charged with the proper maintenance of its fleet of helicopters. But that has to be based initially upon facts and circumstances which are disclosed in the evidence which it is anticipated to be led. The same applies to the performance of the statutory body charged with the regulatory supervision of that company. The expression \"fishing diligence\" was used on a number of occasions. To the layman that might sound as dismissive of genuine concerns of parties to the inquiry. It is not intended to be so; rather, it is a technical term used by lawyers to describe attempts to widen the scope of an inquiry to matters which are either peripheral or are based on no known facts or averments of fact. A fatal accident inquiry has to be kept within reasonable bounds; it must hear evidence relevant to its statutory scope; but its ambit should not be widened to include speculative cross-examination or recovery of evidence about matters the relevance of which is not even hinted at. Thus, there was an insufficient evidential basis for cross-examination intended to identify the possibility of failures by the Civil Aviation Authority in its discharge of its regulatory functions over Bond Offshore Helicopters Limited. Nor was there a sufficient evidential basis to support the recovery of documents relating to the maintenance of the other helicopters within the Bond fleet. Nor was there a proper basis to allow cross-examination in relation to an earlier accident of a Bond helicopter. Indeed, to do so would almost inevitably have resulted in a full inquiry into the circumstances of that accident - a result clearly outwith the scope of this one. Probing witnesses who are giving technical evidence is the proper role of a lawyer, but any alternative technical version of the evidence or the conclusions to be drawn from it should invariably be founded upon other expert evidence. Mr Marshall was not in a position to lead such evidence. In any event, I am confident that if there had been any indication that such matters required investigation the Lord Advocate, acting in the public interest, would have sought to include them within the scope of the inquiry.\n\nThe second matter is the standard of proof about which there was some discussion during the course of the evidence. The law recognises two standards: beyond reasonable doubt and on the balance of probabilities. Beyond reasonable doubt is the standard of proof which applies in criminal trials; the burden of proof is always upon the Crown. Balance of probabilities means what it says: what version is more probable and, as I said to more than one witness, it can usefully be expressed as 51%:49%. That is the standard of proof which I must apply in determining facts in this case. On one critical issue I have also commented upon the higher standard. It is not my role to criticise or approve decisions by the Lord Advocate not to embark upon a prosecution. But I am aware that his decision has caused distress to some, if not all, of the victims' families. By giving my opinion on whether an issue is proved to the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt, I hope that it will at least shed some light upon what might have been the reasons for no prosecution taking place. I do that in the special circumstances of this case, but it is important to emphasise that I am not suggesting that it is appropriate for the Lord Advocate to explain his reasons for the decision he made. That he is independent and not accountable to any interest group or any party affected by his decisions is an important constitutional principle under our law - and indeed is a fundamental strength of it.\n\n[9] I now turn to the discrete matters which I am bound to consider.\n\nThe cause or causes of the accident\n\n[10] It is not difficult to imagine that this is the matter of most concern to the families of the deceased - and indeed others. As will be described, shortly before the accident Bond maintenance employees were responsible for a number of admitted failures correctly to perform maintenance on G-REDL helicopter. The starting point in considering the cause or causes of the subsequent accident might be that it would be an extraordinary coincidence if the failure properly to carry out inspection and maintenance of the helicopter's gearbox was not causative of a catastrophic failure of the same within a matter of days. But, as the evidence made clear, such a coincidence was indeed a possibility.\n\n[11] The AAIB inspectors reached the following conclusions:\n\n1. There was a catastrophic failure of the helicopter's main gearbox (\"MGB\");\n\n2. The failure of the MGB initiated in one of the eight second stage planet gears in the epicyclic module which itself is part of the MGB;\n\n3. The planet gear had fractured as a result of a fatigue crack;\n\n4. The precise origin of that crack could not be determined, although it is likely to have occurred in the loaded area of the planet gear bearing outer race.\n\n5. A metallic particle had been discovered on the epicyclic chip detector during maintenance on 25 March 2009, some 36 flying hours prior to the accident.\n\n6. This was the only indication of the impending failure of the second stage planet gear;\n\n7. The lack of damage on the recovered areas of the bearing outer race indicated that the initiation was not entirely consistent with the understood characteristics of spalling;\n\n8. The possibility of a material defect in the planet gear or damage due to the presence of foreign object debris could not be discounted.\n\n[12] The significance of numbers 7 and 8 is that if the damage was not caused by spalling, there would be no possibility of a causal link to the failures in inspection and maintenance a few days before the accident.\n\n[13] Spalling is described in the AAIB report, as a \"phenomenon which can be found in rolling element bearings\". It is one of the most common reasons for bearing failure. It is otherwise known as \"rolling contact fatigue\", which in layman terms is where two metal surfaces are designed to come into contact with each other. Eventually this can result in the formation of small subsurface fatigue cracks which in turn can result in the release of microscopic particles from highly loaded areas of the surface of one of the metal surfaces, namely the race or rolling elements. The release of these particles leaves craters in the surface which act further to concentrate local stresses. Over time there is an increase in the number and size of the particles released. If not checked, these particles can cause damage to parts of the gearbox which can result in its failure. Spalling comes in two forms. The first form is known as subsurface spalling which was historically the more common form and, put simply, was because of defects in the metal of the relative component. Due to improvements in steel production methods in the 1970's, this type of spalling is now rare. The second form is surface initiated spalling which is known to initiate from surface breaking inclusions.\n\n[14] The significance of the difference in types of spalling in this case is that if the cause of the failure of the gearbox was because of defects in the metal it matters not what failures there were in the maintenance regime. On the other hand, if the cause was some form of surface breaking inclusion then the issue of any failures in maintenance comes sharply into focus.\n\n[15] The conclusion of the AAIB inspectors was that while there was evidence of spalling in the second sense, the possibility of a material defect in the metal could not be discounted. During the course of his evidence, Mark Jarvis, a senior engineering inspector with the AAIB, explained under reference to the report that the evidence of damage to the gears caused by spalling was inconsistent with what one would expect to see in a classic case of spalling. He gave examples of other accidents where spalling was identified as the likely cause. The damage which one would expect was not present in the case of G-REDL. At one point, I invited him to say which of the three possible explanations - spalling, material defect or foreign object debris - was more probable. He insisted that he could not answer that, given the lack of complete evidence, including in particular the unrecovered part of the failed second planet gear of the epicyclic module being the means by which the reduction of the speed of the output from the main module of the gearbox is achieved in order to produce the torque to turn the rotor blades.\n\n[16] This conclusion was disputed by Dr Emmanuel Mermoz who is Eurocopter's head of its Dynamic System Architect Department and described himself as its senior expert in the transmission field. In his opinion, spalling, rather than material defect, was the more probable cause of the gearbox failure. As I understood his evidence, he reached that conclusion for the following reasons:\n\n1. If there had been a material defect it would have become known at a much earlier stage in the lifetime of the epicylic module. In particular, such a defect would have been generated during the manufacture phase and so would have weakened the planet gear from the beginning and would have become apparent during the first 200 flight hours. The G-REDL planet gear had done 3,600 flight hours. Moreover, once a certain number of loads had been applied and the part had not broken it follows that the application of the same load in the future will not break it.\n\n2. The size and shape of the particle found on the epicyclic chip detector on 25 March 2009 were consistent with an advanced stage of classic spalling, as indeed was the evidence that its previous location was at the highest loaded area of the outer race and that it was dented by one or two smaller 'horseshoe' particles before being released from the outer race.\n\n3. The dents on both the inner and outer races were consistent with classic spalling.\n\n4. The start of the zone I crack corresponded to a sub-surface position below the outer race surface.\n\n[17] On the other hand, he accepted that the science of the development of the signs of cracking caused by spalling was not well developed due to the fact that the focus had always been on identification of spalling at an early stage through maintenance.\n\n[18] Both Mr Jarvis and Dr Mermoz were impressive witnesses. Their qualifications to give expert evidence are not in doubt. Mr Jarvis has investigated 300 incidents, 30 involving helicopters, during his time with the AAIB. Dr Mermoz has a formidable academic record, including a PhD in gearbox vibration monitoring. He is an assistant professor at Aix-Marseilles University. Mr Jarvis is of course wholly independent, while Dr Mermoz is employed by Eurocopter which, as the manufacturer of the helicopter, has an interest not to have the cause of the accident identified as a material defect. But I found both the manner and substance of Dr Mermoz's evidence to be such that if he genuinely thought that this was the cause of the accident he would not have hesitated to say so.\n\n[19] At the end of the day both witnesses broadly agreed on the factors which required to be taken into account. The difference between them was about what emphasis should be placed on each factor. Counsel for Eurocopter described Mr Jarvis' approach as cautious. I agree with that. But it does not follow that Dr Mermoz was being incautious. On the contrary, I found his evidence to be measured and carefully expressed with no hint of exaggeration. As both witnesses acknowledged, the difficulty in this case was that the small piece of the helicopter which would have proved the matter beyond any doubt had not been recovered from the seabed and they therefore had no choice but to draw conclusions as best as they could from the imperfect evidence before them.\n\n[20] In my opinion, on the balance of probabilities the conclusion reached by Dr Mermoz ought to be preferred. It was agreed by them both that spalling is the most common cause of damage to helicopter gearboxes. In contrast, material defect is rare. As Mr Jarvis recognised, there was no evidence which directly pointed to material defect as the cause. He acknowledged that the planet gear had completed a great many cycles and was one of the hardest working components in the helicopter. He also agreed that the examination of the production records and the sampling of test specimens showed that there were no apparent defects in the planet gear. But, for me, the most compelling factor in favour of Dr Mermoz's conclusion came in three passages from Mr Jarvis' evidence.\n\n[21] In a discussion with me about the role of the European Aviation Safety Agency (\"EASA\"), Mr Jarvis said this:\n\n\"The EASA go through their processes and have concluded that the gear meets the certification requirements. The AAIB's perspective is that there is the potential, however low [my italics], for a defect to exist within the body of the gear and the EASA recognise that the potential exists.\"\n\n[22] During cross-examination, there was the following exchange:\n\n\"Q. We have covered spalling. Can we then go on to consider the material defect and, as I have noted... , you have described the prospect of a material defect being \"potential, however low that is\". You remember saying that?\n\nQ. Is it low because if you have a material defect it would have been generated in the manufacturing phase and would have weakened the planet gear from the outset?\n\nA. The probability is low [my italics] because you would expect - the normal behaviour is you would get the vast majority of failures due to material defect relatively early in the component's life. As the component goes through its life, the probability of failure decreases but never reaches zero.\n\nQ. Is that because one reaches what might be termed the asymptote?\n\nQ. Does that mean in layman's terms essentially it's a fatigue limit beyond which failure is unlikely to occur because the part essentially will go on ad infinitum, as it were? That's in laymen's terms; please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nA. I would say that it means that the probability of failure becomes very low [my italics] for whatever reason but never reaches zero.\"\n\n[23] In a further passage, there was another exchange:\n\n\"Q. In short, Mr Jarvis, I suggest to you that it is extremely unlikely that there would have been a material defect in this part [the planet gear]?\n\nA. As I've said previously, however unlikely [my italics], the possibility remains that material defect was present and may have contributed to this accident.\"\n\n[24] It seems to me that these passages sit uneasily with Mr Jarvis' conclusion that even on the balance of probabilities he cannot accept that spalling was the cause. On the contrary, they are a clear indication that he ought to have readily concluded that material defect was improbable.\n\n[25] Accordingly, for the reasons I have given I hold on the balance of probabilities that the cause of the accident was spalling and not material defect. But if the standard of proof has been beyond reasonable doubt, I would be bound to have concluded that (a) in the absence of the crucial part of the planet gear, (b) the acceptance by both experts that material defect cannot be completely ruled out and (c) in the face of the conclusion reached by Mr Jarvis, a reasonable doubt would remain.\n\n[26] As I have earlier described, Mr Jarvis proposed three possibilities as the cause, namely spalling , material defect and foreign object debris. Dr Mermoz preferred to identify the choice as either material defect or spalling, but that the latter could also arise through foreign object debris. I prefer Dr Mermoz's evidence on this point. Further, I hold that foreign object debris can be ruled out, again on the balance of probabilities, not least because of Mr Jarvis' evidence that Bond \"had taken... every conceivable step to minimise the opportunity for FOD to enter the gearbox.\"\n\nThe role of Bond Offshore Helicopters Limited in the cause or causes of the accident\n\n[27] It was not disputed by any witness at the inquiry that the primary means of ensuring that spalling does not result in gearbox failure is through regular maintenance. The maintenance carried out by Bond from 25 March 2009 until the date of the accident is set out fully in the AAIB report. I do not intend to rehearse it in comprehensive detail. Nor was there any dispute, particularly by Bond, that they had failed to carry out maintenance of the helicopter's gearbox in accordance with the recognised procedures. The relevant circumstances of Bond's maintenance can be summarised as follows:\n\n1. The primary method for locating and capturing metal particles, otherwise known as chips, caused by spalling is by means of magnetic chip detectors. The main gear box is fitted with two such detectors. One is located in the sump area below the main module and the other is adjacent to the epicyclic gearbox module. A third detector is located in the conical housing. The main module chip detector provides the flight crew with a visual warning of the detection of a magnetic chip. It is also recorded on the Health and Usage Monitoring System (\"HUMS\"). The epicyclic chip detector was a relatively recent innovation and was introduced to collect most of the chips generated by the epicyclic module, thereby preventing them from contaminating the main module.\n\n2. The approved maintenance programme included a requirement to carry out a periodic visual inspection of each magnetic plug for contamination in accordance with Eurocopter's Aircraft Maintenance Manual, in terms of Task No. 60-00-00-212 entitled \"Checking a Magnetic Element\". For the epicyclic module, the manual directed that the engineer extracts the magnetic plug and then checks it for collected particles. If particles are found, the engineer should remove the epicyclic module, remove all the particles, analyse them and in the event that they fall outwith the limits of the acceptable criteria have the module sent to Eurocopter for survey.\n\n3. HUMS was mandatory on helicopters such as G-REDL but in the industry was regarded as a maintenance advisory tool and not as the primary method for detecting gearbox degradation. Before and during a flight, data is collected on the HUMS data card, the information on which is downloaded to the operator's ground station where it can be scrutinised. The recorded data includes chip detection.\n\n4. On 25 March 2009, after completion of turnaround maintenance procedure and after G-REDL had set off on its second series of flights for the day, a Bond engineer noted on the downloaded HUMS data that an epicyclic module chip warning had been recorded. On the helicopter's return a physical inspection of all the MGB magnetic chip detectors was carried out, but no particles were found on any of them. The helicopter was removed from service to allow further investigation. Later, an engineer checked the epicyclic chip detector and discovered a small metallic particle which was removed.\n\n5. In the meantime, Bond's HUMS specialist engineer was inspecting the downloaded data and observed an abnormal vibration trend on the main module bevel gear. He contacted the HUMS specialist at Eurocopter. He did so by telephone. During the course of telephone conversations the engineer who had found the particle told the Bond HUMS specialist of that fact and he passed it on to the Eurocopter HUMS specialist. It is at this point that the evidence of the Bond witnesses and the Eurocopter witnesses no longer coincides. I have not been able to decide which version to believe. But at the very least it can be said that there developed a misunderstanding about the nature and location of the particle. The Eurocopter HUMS specialist thought that metallic particles had been found in the main module. Even more critically, he and his colleagues were under the misapprehension that the Bond engineers had already performed certain tasks set out in the maintenance manual, including task no. 60-00-00-212. Instead of advising Bond to carry out that task, Eurocopter advised them to follow another work card. This required, amongst other things, an inspection of the particle to discover whether it was of such a size or form which would prevent the helicopter being returned to service. The Bond engineer misidentified the particle, with the result that the gearbox was declared as serviceable. Despite this conclusion the Bond engineers still decided to take a further precautionary step - to cover the possibility of the gearbox producing more metallic particles after the helicopter's return to operation. This involved the inspection of the epicyclic and main module chip detectors every shut down for the next 25 flying hours. That was duly done (indeed it was done for a total of 36 flying hours). No additional particles were detected. In addition, Bond had inspected the epicyclic module oil filter, drained the oil through filtered paper and refilled with new oil.\n\n6. It transpired that the concern about the abnormal vibration trend on the main module bevel gear proved to be groundless.\n\n7. The proper means of communication between an operator and the manufacturer about a possible fault was by means of one or other of two written forms (known as 'EDR' or 'DR'), neither of which was used on this occasion.\n\n[28] Predictably, during the course of the inquiry there was much discussion about the circumstances which led Bond not to follow the clear terms of the maintenance manual by performing task no. 60-00-00-212. Bond readily acknowledged that they ought to have done so. They had little choice in making that admission given the clear terms of the manual. Counsel for Bond correctly submitted that the existence of the epicyclic module detectors \"did not have a high profile\". He also correctly pointed out that Mr Jarvis agreed that there was a joint responsibility on both the manufacturer and the operator to ensure that recognised procedures were followed, a point which Eurocopter readily acknowledged. But in my opinion none of that matters; nor does it mitigate the responsibility of Bond to follow the manual. On many occasions during the inquiry it was acknowledged that the primary rule throughout the industry is that everything must be done by the book - that is to say, in accordance with the maintenance manual. There can therefore be no excuse for not doing so.\n\n[29] The issue of the misidentification of the particle is of secondary importance, given that it was a consequence only of Bond's failure to perform the correct task. Its relevance in identifying causes of the accident is in my opinion peripheral, although, it has resulted in a change in the instructions given by Eurocopter when the task is being performed. Mr Marshall invited me to conclude that I should not believe the engineer's evidence that he thought the chip was silver or cadmium but magnetic. If he meant that the engineer was being untruthful, I do not agree. All that it indicates to me is that the engineer was confused. At the end of the day, it does not matter: the identification was wrong.\n\n[30] In these circumstances, where it is acknowledged by Bond that they failed to follow the maintenance procedures, the next question is whether the admitted failure was one of the causes of the accident. What would have happened if task no. 60-00-00-212 had been performed? Counsel for Bond submitted that it is simply not known what, if anything, would have been found if the epicyclic module had been removed. Mr Main for the Crown took the same view. He submitted that the fact that no chips had been detected prior to 24 March 2009 and none was found during the period of close monitoring between 26 and 31 March might tend to suggest that no more particles would have been found on the magnets, or at least in sufficient quantities to result in the removal of the gearbox. That view is primarily based upon the evidence of Mr Jarvis, but it is instructive to quote his opinion in full:\n\n\"Had the gearbox - the epicyclic module been lifted and other material been found on the magnets enough to reject the gearbox, then that unit would have been sent for overhaul and the defective pieces would have been taken out of service. What we can't say, my Lord, is had Bond opened the gearbox and carried out that inspection, we can't say that they would have found enough material to reject the gearbox because we believe the failure mode doesn't follow the normal pattern of a spalling failure.\"\n\nIt is therefore clear that his opinion on this matter is coloured by his concern about spalling, rather than material defect or FOD, being the probable cause.\n\n[31] There is not a great deal of evidence to support the view that if Bond had removed the epicyclic module they would have found sufficient evidence of particles on the magnets to warrant removing the gearbox from service. As Dr Mermoz said, the reason the matter is in doubt is because Bond failed to follow the correct procedure. In the AAIB report, data is shown of all previously recorded cases where particles had been found on the MGB detectors. This was put to Dr Mermoz. As I understood his evidence, he pointed out that on two occasions, one in 2001 and the other in 2005, only a small quantity of particles was found on the epicyclic magnetic plugs but a lot were found on the magnets in the standard gearbox. On another occasion in 2005 no detection of particles was reported on the epicyclic magnetic plugs but there must have been the discovery of a particle to result in the operator taking the steps it did. Again, there proved to be the presence of particles on the magnets in the standard gearbox. Finally, in 2009 particles were found but their number is not described (apart from being less than 100mm2 and under reference to a photograph which was not produced in evidence), although lots of particles were again found in the standard gearbox magnets.\n\n[32] In my opinion, these examples are inconclusive, except that they do indicate that where particles are found on the epicyclic magnets there will be more, perhaps many more, in other parts of the gearbox. That is, I think, consistent with Dr Mermoz's evidence.\n\n[33] In this case we know that one chip was detected on 25 March 2009 and scrutiny of it confirmed that there had been other smaller particles. We also know that no more chips were detected during the 25 flying hour monitoring period. Dr Mermoz was himself inconclusive:\n\n\"... the normal way to deal with spalling is that when you have got one particle and, especially in the gearbox, with the magnet, was to open to collect the particle. All the history that we've got, how it is quite early detection of spalling. Now the period that you are describing is a period on which this opportunity to stop the spalling has been missed and then you're asking to me what is the perception of what will be the rate of the generation, the rate of particle generation during that period? So what I can say which it's a continuous process to make spalling, so it should have generated particles, but as the magnets were installed in the gearbox the chip detector was only collecting a part of the particles. So it could be that particle has been generated (inaudible) but had been kept on the magnet.\"\n\nDr Mermoz earned my admiration for the manner in which he gave such technical evidence in a foreign tongue, even with an interpreter being present if he required her. But this is one passage which is not easy to interpret. It seems to me, however, that he is saying that the instant case is probably one of detection of spalling in its early stages, but that particles would have been found on the gearbox detectors. But that still leaves unanswered whether the amount and nature of the chips which would have been discovered would have been sufficient to warrant the gearbox being removed.\n\n[34] I therefore hold that while it is certainly possible that if Bond had followed task no. 60-00-00-212 they would have removed the gearbox, on the evidence that fact has not been proved on the balance of probabilities.\n\n[35] I have already mentioned the employment of the HUMS machine. There was a good deal of evidence about its use during the course of the inquiry. Mr Marshall submitted that the evidence disclosed that the Bond engineering staff was insufficiently trained and experienced to employ it effectively. It is certainly true that at the time of the accident there appeared to be a lack of understanding of the possibility that the data card could either be removed too early by the pilots upon landing or that the information on it could reach the point where it was overloaded. But it was still understood that the information on it was available for inspection, albeit without the benefit of warning lights which would help to focus attention on possible problems. And, in any event, the HUMS machine was intended primarily as a diagnostic tool which would record trends over a period of time. As has been said, the principal means of ensuring the proper maintenance of the helicopter was by rigorous application of the maintenance manual. In this case the spalling, whether at an early stage or not, might have been detected if that had been done. The effectiveness of HUMS is therefore of secondary importance.\n\nThe overall performance of Bond Offshore Helicopters Limited\n\n[36] Mr Marshall invited me to draw a number of adverse conclusions about Bond's performance as operators of helicopters. These were,\n\n1. That record keeping by Bond's engineering staff was very poor, leading to doubts about what maintenance had actually been performed and what had not;\n\n2. That Bond's engineering staff displayed a tick-box mentality which resulted in failure to recognise errors by colleagues;\n\n3. That Bond's engineering management was incompetent, being unable to confirm that procedures were being followed or to challenge staff to establish procedures were being followed, and having insufficient knowledge and understanding of the maintenance procedures themselves to be aware whether work was being done properly;\n\n4. That the training of Bond's engineering staff, including the management, was inadequate; and\n\n5. That Bond's engineering staff was under pressure to carry out planned maintenance. Deciding not to perform unplanned maintenance accordingly created more time for planned maintenance.\n\n[37] Mr Marshall set out in his submissions the parts of the evidence which supported these conclusions. I have studied them with care. But I am not prepared to agree with him.\n\n[38] Like Mr Marshall, I had the benefit of considering the demeanour of all of the Bond witnesses, as well as hearing their evidence as recorded in the transcript. My overall impression was that all of the witnesses were genuinely trying to recall what occurred. I did not consider that any of them was being untruthful; nor did they attempt to put a gloss over any failings. On the contrary, I considered that they all had tried to carry out their jobs as diligently as they could. All of them impressed me as engineers who well understood the vital importance of their role in ensuring the safety of the pilots and passengers who used the company's aircraft. Nor did I detect that there was a culture within the company of not taking training seriously or that the staff had insufficient resources to perform their functions properly. That was the view of the AAIB and the Civil Aviation Authority inspectors. It is certainly true that there was a laxity in following the correct procedures in dealings with Eurocopter - and undoubtedly that should not have happened. But I am not prepared to conclude from that failure that there were systemic defects in the remainder of the maintenance procedures and their implementation. Again, there were failures in record keeping, but as the CAA witnesses confirmed such failures, while not condoned, are to be expected. Indeed, Mr Jarvis said,\n\n\"Although discrepancies in the aircraft records were identified it is the opinion of the AAIB that these did not contribute to the accident. Additionally it should be stated that it is, in the AAIB's experience, not unusual to find discrepancies in aircraft technical records.\"\n\nThat is not to suggest that record keeping is unimportant; on the contrary, it is vital. But the evidence was that failures, invariably minor, will almost inevitably occur.\n\n[39] The essential fact is that everyone in the company well knew that maintenance must be done by the book. On one occasion, that fundamental rule was broken. It resulted in the failure to detect a significant fault in the helicopter's gearbox, which possibly - but only possibly - resulted in the crash.\n\nThe role of the AAIB\n\n[40] Mr Marshall had a series of criticisms of the AAIB. He had three complaints:\n\n1. Early on in its investigation the AAIB focussed upon the precise cause of the failure of the second stage planet gear and thereby had only a limited scrutiny of Bond's management, maintenance staff, maintenance procedures and record keeping;\n\n2. The AAIB did not recover the HUMS defect log, flight reports, usage reports or health reports for the helicopter;\n\n3. The AAIB's investigations are flawed in that there is no direct communication among its inspectors carrying out simultaneous investigations of the same operator relating to separate incidents, resulting in systemic organisational and management failures of an operator less likely to be observed.\n\n[41] In his submissions, Mr Marshall cites a number of passages in the evidence, as well as Mr Jarvis' answers to supplementary questions after his evidence had been completed. It is obvious that the extent, if at all, that this evidence supports the contentions made is principally to do with HUMS. I have already said that Bond and others accepted that the possibility of losing data, at least in its user friendly form, was not fully understood at the time of the accident. And while it is acknowledged that the CAA has for a number of years regarded the use of HUMS to be compulsory for helicopters working within hostile environments, its significance should not be overstated. It is primarily a diagnostic tool, its principal benefit is to provide trends over time, not immediate alarms indicating risks of potentially catastrophic events, and it is accordingly no substitute for planned maintenance and inspection. Certain steps have been taken to improve its effectiveness, but there is a danger in focussing too much upon its use and thereby diverting attention from the vital importance of maintenance. There is no suggestion in the evidence that better use of it prior to the accident would have prevented it.\n\n[42] Mr Marshall's proposition that there was a failure to liaise with the other AAIB inspectors involved in an accident of another Bond helicopter is based on nothing other than assertion. Mr Jarvis expressly denied it:\n\n\"In the event that common issues are developed within investigations, however current or closed they may be, they will be brought together and examined as a whole on those issues.\"\n\n[43] The crash of G-REDL was a tragedy. Coupled with the other helicopter accidents in Scotland over the recent past, it has raised fundamental questions about the safety of helicopters, not least in the oil and gas industry of the North Sea. It cost the lives of 16 men. It has caused considerable public interest. It is therefore particularly important that whatever lessons can be learned from it are properly identified and acted upon.\n\n[44] The AAIB report sets out in considerable detail what recommendations were made and the manner in which various parties acted upon them. I do not intend to repeat them all here. But I shall mention some of them, particularly those which are contested.\n\n[45] The AAIB report explains steps taken by a number of regulatory authorities to study the fatigue tolerance of the structure of helicopters, including the main rotor drive system. A joint working group was formed in 2000 among EASA, the Federal Aviation Administration, the rotocraft industry and the Technical Oversight Group for Ageing Aircraft. It recommended changes to fatigue evaluation requirements and resulted in the publication by EASA of a notice of proposed amendment to introduce improvements in the ability to avoid catastrophic failures of primary structure, including rotor transmission components. In that context and as a result of the accident, the AAIB recommended that EASA re-evaluate the certification of the gearbox to take account of this proposed amendment. Mr Jarvis advised the inquiry that EASA has not yet concluded its work in the light of that recommendation. His understanding was that EASA expected to complete the work within 18 months to two years from the date of the AAIB report, which would mean that it ought to have been completed by no later than October last year. I heard no evidence from EASA or any other party about the reasons for the delay - there may be completely understandable ones. But given the uncertainty raised because of recent helicopter accidents, it seems to me that EASA should complete their work as quickly as possible, not least to maintain public confidence in the type of helicopter involved in this accident.\n\n[46] AAIB also recommended to Eurocopter that it should introduce further means of identifying in-service gearbox component degradation, such as debris analysis of the main gearbox oil. As Mr Jarvis explained, this recommendation was made primarily because of his concern that this was not a classic spalling case. The traditional method of debris analysis is by means of a spectrographic oil analysis programme (\"SOAP\"). That was done on the Puma and Super Puma fleet until 1986 and is still done by the Royal Air Force. Mr Jarvis also advised that there are some newer systems available which analyse the oil on a real time basis which are particularly useful because they are more scientific in nature and rely less on the expert interpretation of the maintenance engineer.\n\n[47] Eurocopter has not accepted this recommendation. It gave a number of reasons, but the primary one was that detection by magnetic plugs and chip detectors was the best method, given that SOAP was outdated because of the improvements in design of the Super Puma gearbox. In his evidence, Dr Mermoz set out in detail why he considered that SOAP analysis should not be introduced, particularly for spalling.\n\n[48] I am unable to reach a concluded view on these competing arguments. I can say, however, that it was unfortunate that the other potential methods for oil analysis, as mentioned by Mr Jarvis, were not discussed. I will question later whether it should always be that regarding regular maintenance as the principal means of ensuring the safety of helicopters is correct, but in the present context I consider that steps should be taken by Eurocopter in discussion with the CAA and EASA to consider whether the other methods of oil analysis should be applied to Super Puma helicopters. For aught yet seen, a problem with such methods might be the risk of false readings, which is an issue with SOAP. That can result in economic consequences. But the helicopter industry as a whole must also be reminded that its primary responsibility is the safety of its passengers and crews. Indeed, to compromise on that responsibility can potentially be self-defeating in purely economic terms as well.\n\n[49] The AAIB also made a recommendation that there be installed a cockpit warning light in the event of an epicyclic chip detection. As another AAIB senior inspector, Timothy Atkinson, explained, the rationale behind that was that this accident had shown that perhaps there had been a very short period of time between the first indication of a problem with the gearbox and its failure. But he readily accepted that it was unlikely that such a warning light would have prevented the accident. He also accepted that there was a danger of a false reading which, depending upon what instructions were available to the pilot, might result in an unnecessary ditching of the aircraft into the sea with the dangers which that might cause. On the other hand, he argued that the advantage of a warning light coming on before take-off would mean that the helicopter would immediately be taken out of service and inspected.\n\n[50] Eurocopter do not consider that such a warning light should be fitted, although it does now offer it as an option to customers. It is fitted as standard to the Eurocopter EC225 LP model helicopter. The reasons for Eurocopter's view are as set out in its response to the AAIB recommendation.\n\n[51] I do not consider it appropriate for me to make a recommendation that the warning light be a compulsory part of the Super Puma fleet. The possibility of a false reading is plainly a very real one - and could result in an additional hazard for passengers and crew. In any event, its availability on G-REDL would not have avoided the accident. It is therefore a peripheral issue to the causes of the accident. There was no hint that its unavailability was because of any desire of Eurocopter to save money. As in most issues of safety, this is a case of weighing up the advantages and disadvantages. The evidence against Eurocopter's position was not compelling enough for me to consider that its approach was plainly wrong.\n\n[52] Mr Marshall criticised the time which it has taken since the accident both in the publication of the AAIB report and the start of this inquiry. I consider he was well justified in doing so. It is instructive to note that the Lockerbie fatal accident inquiry occurred in less than three years from the date of the crash - in contrast to this inquiry which was nearly five years. The Crown produced with its submissions a timeline showing what steps were taken. The period of the AAIB investigation was not explored in any detail in the evidence. I, myself, am aware of the difficulties which occurred in finding suitable dates and venue. I could easily explain all the steps taken by me and the Scottish Court Service. But I do not think that a detailed investigation of every action taken by every public body, whether investigatory, supervisory or judicial, over every month would add much. What can, I think, very properly be said is that nearly five years is on any view far too long and that we all have a responsibility for that. And that everyone concerned in future fatal accidents involving aircraft of whatever kind should do much better.\n\n[53] Mr Marshall was also critical of the problems caused by the delay in providing him with reports and productions in order to prepare properly for the inquiry. I also have some sympathy with that. It was, for example, difficult to understand why the CAA report and the identification of its witnesses were unavailable until after the inquiry started. Nevertheless, what I can say is that in the result I do not consider that my investigation was hampered by any such delay. I am reasonably satisfied that the fundamental issues have been properly aired and I can detect nothing obvious to me that was missed from proper inquiry. Having said that, I hope that the Crown will in the future be mindful of the need to give full disclosure of material as far in advance of an inquiry as is possible - and that other agencies upon whom the Crown has to rely are careful to remember that all parties to an inquiry need proper time to carry out their own preparations.\n\n[54] There has been considerable media interest in this fatal accident inquiry. It took place in the context of a number of major accidents involving helicopters in the North Sea and elsewhere. Quite properly, the other accidents, some fatal, were not discussed in the evidence. But it is impossible not to be aware of the overall context within which this inquiry took place. It would be quite improper for me to discuss these other accidents, not least because, as this inquiry has shown, the reality is that the causes of any accident, particularly one involving a technically sophisticated machine such as an aircraft, will be identified only after exhaustive inquiry of complex and very technical evidence. I am aware from Press reports that a parliamentary inquiry is proceeding into the overall issue of helicopter safety and that even since the evidence closed the CAA has issued further instructions in relation to the employment of helicopters in the North Sea. All that I can say is that I hope that this determination illustrates how complex the causes of an accident can be and that there is a danger in drawing general conclusions without due and proper investigation of the facts in each case.\n\n[55] But having said that, I should add this:\n\nDuring the course of his evidence, I asked Mr Jarvis if he thought there was something inherently more dangerous in helicopters compared to other aircraft. He replied as follows:\n\n\"It's a function of the design of helicopters, my Lord, in that rotory wing aircraft, helicopters, essentially have a critical load path through the gearbox to the rotor. Fixed wing aircraft can have - fixed wing aircraft fly by means of structure which can be made inherently fail-safe. Helicopters fly by means of a mechanism which is a mechanical unit and is thereby potentially more prone to failure and that really is the issue between fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft, my Lord. One flies by means of a mechanism; the other flies by means of its structure and that gives you different levels of achievability in terms of safety and redundancy.\"\n\n[56] A recurring theme during the course of the inquiry was that the key to ensuring safety of helicopters and preventing catastrophic mechanical failure was rigorous maintenance procedures. In this particular case, it was primarily about how to detect spalling in a gearbox. There was evidence about how the materials used to manufacture a helicopter gearbox have greatly improved over the last 40 years or so. But there still is a general acceptance that spalling is inevitable. The evidence did not however rule out the possibility of a material defect in the metal itself. Nor was there any discussion about what, if any, alternative metals or other materials might exist which would be less likely to have a material defect or, perhaps more relevantly, would prevent spalling altogether. I mention this because it is clear that no matter the rigorous nature of maintenance procedures it is almost inevitable that human error will occur from time to time. Given the heightened risk of failure of rotory wing aircraft as described by Mr Jarvis, perhaps it should be the ambition of manufacturers to focus their future research on finding a means by which helicopters can be manufactured so as to diminish the critical importance of regular maintenance and to improve the inherent integrity of the materials from which they are built.\n\nSection 6(1)(a) - Where and when the deaths and the accident resulting in the deaths took place:\n\ndied at about 1355 hours on 1 April 2009 on board the Mark 2 Super Puma AS332 L2 helicopter, registered number G-REDL, owned and operated by Bond Offshore Helicopters Limited (\"Bond\"), then travelling between the Miller Platform, Miller Oil and Gas Field, 145 nautical miles north east of Aberdeen and the Bond offshore helicopter base at Aberdeen Airport, at a location approximately 11 nautical miles north east of Peterhead.\n\nSection 6(1)(b) - The causes of such deaths and the accident resulting in the deaths:\n\n(1) In respect of each of said John Brian Hugh Barkley, Raymond Steele Doyle, James John Edwards, Vernon John Elrick, Nairn James Ferrier, Warren George Mitchell, Stuart Lee Wood and Mihails Zuravskis, the cause of death was multiple injuries sustained as a passenger involved in the crash of the said helicopter at sea. The indications were that the death was as a result of sudden deceleration and blunt force impact and there was nothing to suggest survival with subsequent drowning.\n\n(2) In respect of each of said Paul Stephen Burnham, James Antal Reamonn Stephen Costello, Alexander Gordon Dallas, Nolan Carl Goble, Gareth Wyn Hughes, Richard Anthony Menzies, David John Rae and Leslie Stanley Taylor, the cause of death was multiple injuries sustained during the said crash. The pattern of injury was entirely consistent with the circumstances and death would have been instantaneous.\n\n(3) The cause of the accident which resulted in said deaths was the catastrophic failure of the main rotor gearbox of the said helicopter on the said date, which was as a result of a fatigue fracture of a second stage planet gear in the epicyclic module and which caused the helicopter to descend into the sea.\n\n(4) The fatigue fracture of the second stage planet gear in the epicyclic module was caused by spalling.\n\nSection 6(1)(c) - The reasonable precautions, if any, whereby the deaths and the accident resulting in the deaths might have been avoided\n\nIt is possible that if the following failures by Bond had not occurred the accident might have been avoided:\n\n(a) Bond failed to perform task no. 60.00.00.212 of the aircraft maintenance manual on 25 March 2009 after a metal particle had been discovered on the said helicopter's epicyclic chip detector, which would have resulted in the removal of the epicyclic module and an examination of the magnets on the separator plates;\n\n(b) Bond failed to ensure that communications with the manufacturer of the said helicopter, Eurocopter, on 25 March 2009 were done in accordance with the recognised procedures, with the result that misunderstandings arose between the parties, which contributed to the failure by Bond to perform task no. 60.00.00.212;\n\n(c) Bond failed to identify the nature of the substance of the said metal particle when on 25 March 2009 performing task no. 20.08.01.601 of the aircraft maintenance manual and in doing so might have lost the opportunity to avoid the consequences of its failure to perform task no. 60.00.00.212.\n\nSection 6(1)(d) - The defects, if any, in any system of working which contributed to the deaths or the accident resulting in the deaths\n\nOn the evidence, no such defects exist.\n\nSection 6(1)(e) - Any other facts which are relevant to the circumstances of the deaths\n\n(a) The joint working group of the European Aviation Safety Agency (\"EASA\"), the Federal Aviation Administration, the rotocraft industry and the Technical Oversight Group for Ageing Aircraft has considered a proposal by EASA to introduce improvements in the ability to avoid catastrophic failures of primary structures, including rotor transmission components, of helicopters. EASA intends to incorporate this amendment into its certification standard 29.517. It should do so as soon as possible.\n\n(b) Eurocopter, the Civil Aviation Authority and EASA have not together considered methods of oil analysis of Super Puma helicopters, other than by means of a spectrographic oil analysis programme. They should do so.\n\n(c) The traditional means by which helicopter safety is ensured is by way of rigorous maintenance procedures. Helicopter manufacturers should consider whether future research and development should focus upon whether alternative metals or other materials can be developed to reduce, or eliminate, the risk of spalling in helicopter gearboxes and thereby lessen the dependence upon maintenance procedures as the primary method of ensuring safety.",

                "text": "Australian Grand Prix chief executive Andrew Westacott says Red Bull's appeal against Daniel Ricciardo's disqualification could take weeks to conclude.\n\nRicciardo finished second in yesterday's race - the best result for a local driver in an Australian F1 Grand Prix.\n\nBut world motorsport's governing body, the FIA (International Federation of Automobiles), later quashed the result, ruling the team breached fuel-flow rules.\n\nThe regulations, which only allow a fuel flow of 100 kilograms per hour, were only introduced this year and mark a drastic reduction from last year's averages of approximately 170kg/h.\n\nOn top of that, Westacott says the equipment used to disqualify Daniel Ricciardo from the race had not been functioning properly for most of the weekend.\n\n\"These sensors were faulty on Friday, the FIA and Red Bull says 'It's not working, put in a new one for Saturday',\" he said.\n\n\"They put in a new one for Saturday, that didn't work, they went back to the one on Friday.\"\n\nHe says Red Bull are in with a chance of winning the appeal and having Ricciardo's second place reinstated.\n\n\"Red Bull knows their technical qualifications and the details associated with the fuel injectors in their engines. They believe they've got solid grounds.\"\n\nThe team's statement informing of their intention to appeal suggested they did not trust the readings given by the FIA's instruments.\n\n\"Inconsistencies with the FIA fuel flow meter have been prevalent all weekend up and down the pit lane,\" they said.\n\n\"The team and Renault are confident the fuel supplied to the engine is in full compliance with the regulations.\"\n\nRed Bull boss Christian Horner said Ricciardo was blameless in the whole ordeal as he vowed to continue the team's fight against the ruling.\n\n\"It is no fault of Daniel. I don't believe it is the fault of the team,\" Horner said.\n\n\"I believe we have been compliant to the rules. I am extremely disappointed, quite surprised... hopefully through the appeal process it will be quite clear that the car has conformed at all times to the regulations.\n\n\"We would not be appealing unless we were extremely confident that we have a defendable case,\" he added.",

                "text": "Australian Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo has been disqualified for exceeding the maximum allowed fuel flow during his race to claim a second place finish at the Australian Formula One Grand Prix on Sunday.\n\nRicciardo looked to have made history by becoming the first local to finish in a podium place at the Australian Grand Prix in the Formula One era, only for his car to be referred to stewards.\n\n\"During the race, car number 03 has exceeded consistently the maximum allowed fuel flow of 100kg/h,\" technical delegate Jo Bauer said.\n\n\"As this is not in compliance ... I am referring this matter to the stewards for their consideration.\"\n\nStewards deliberated for five hours before disqualifying Ricciardo late on Sunday night.\n\nRed Bull immediately said it would appeal against the disqualification.\n\nThe 24-year-old's fuel flow was in breach of Article 5.1.4 of the 2014 Formula One technical regulations, and FIA race director Charlie Whiting had said on Thursday there would be a zero-tolerance policy to the fuel flow issue.\n\nSunday would have been Ricciardo's first career podium finish. Instead, McLaren's Danish rookie Kevin Magnussen was promoted to second and his McLaren team-mate Jenson Button was bumped up to third.\n\nEarlier, Nico Rosberg claimed victory in the opening race of the F1 season at Albert Park, beating Ricciardo by 24 seconds.\n\nThe German Mercedes driver's win came after team-mate Lewis Hamilton retired early in the race with engine problems about the same time defending champion Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull also exited.\n\nThe retirements meant both Rosberg and Ricciardo rocketed to the forefront of race contention, having qualified in third and second positions respectively.\n\nRosberg had built up a 14-second lead after 32 laps and, even with a pit-stop still to make on Ricciardo, extended that to more than 16 seconds by the 43rd lap.\n\nUltimately, Rosberg finished 24 seconds ahead of the Australian, in a formidable title warning of the capabilities of Mercedes' W05 car to the rest of the chasing pack.\n\n\"Brilliant guys. What a car you gave me, what a car,\" an elated Rosberg bellowed over Mercedes team radio.\n\nMagnussen remarkably became the first Danish driver to claim a Formula One podium finish, all on his debut Formula One race.\n\nFerrari's Fernando Alonso finished fifth but was later promoted to fourth after Ricciardo's disqualification.\n\nThe race started in spectacular fashion as Caterham's Kamui Kobayashi - on his return to Formula One - clipped Williams' Felipe Massa on the first corner, sending both drivers sprawling into the gravel and out of the race.\n\nPole-sitter Hamilton was forced to retire with an engine complaint in just the third lap, before Vettel pulled into the pits to retire soon after, having struggled with power problems from the first lap.\n\nWilliams driver Valtteri Bottas also pushed too hard coming out of turn 10, hitting the wall hard and breaking his rear rim, losing the wheel two corners later.\n\nBottas's lost wheel forced the Finn down the grid and also brought out the safety car, prompting early, strategic pit-stops from the race leaders during the 12th lap.\n\nTwenty laps in, Ricciardo was still trailing Rosberg by about five seconds, before being told over the Red Bull radio he no longer needed to conserve fuel, prompting an aggressive push from the Australian.\n\nMcLaren's Button pitted to take on medium tyres after 32 laps, allowing the Briton to complete the remainder of the race without stops after using both tyre compounds.\n\nApplause then emerged from the Williams garage when Bottas - having lost his tyre so early in the race - temporarily moved up to fifth place, having made use of the safety car superbly to repair the damage to his wheel.\n\nAfter he narrowed the gap between second and third to 1.1 seconds on the 49th lap, Magnussen received orders to put the pressure on Ricciardo, who looked to be struggling with eight laps to go.\n\nBut with the race all but Rosberg's, Ricciardo showed tremendous poise to hold off the hyper-talented Magnussen and secure the runner-up spot.\n\nRace winner Rosberg praised his Mercedes team, saying the Melbourne win would lay the foundations for a real tilt at the drivers' and constructors' championships.\n\n\"It has been an amazing time in Melbourne. The support has been fantastic, Daniel got more support than me, but that's normal,\" he said.\n\n\"It has been an amazing day. Everyone has worked so hard over the weather and to have such an amazing [W05] Silver Arrow is unbelievable.\n\n\"The reliability was good and it's the perfect start to the season.\"\n\nA beaming Ricciardo thanked the enthusiastic crowd - which erupted in applause when he lifted his second-place silverware - for the \"overwhelming\" support.\n\n\"Just two or three weeks ago, I would have bet everything I had that we would not be standing up here,\" Ricciardo said on the podium.\n\n\"Full credit to the team for an unbelievable turnaround. I don't understand how they did it, but they did.\n\n\"And thanks to the Aussie fans. The support has been completely overwhelming.\"\n\nBut Ricciardo's joy would turn to abject disappointment after stewards converted his runner-up finish to a DQ.\n\nAhead of the disqualification's confirmation, Ricciardo expressed his pride in his race performance.\n\n\"Whatever the outcome I'm really proud of what I did today. There are more positives than negatives,\" he said.\n\nRed Bull released a short statement insisting its fuel use and engine were in compliance with the rules.",

I'm really thankful to Mercedes for giving me such an amazing car.\n\n\"There is a lot of work to do. We can still improve a lot and we must because the competitors are not going to be asleep.\"\n\nBehind him, Ricciardo was able to complete a race distance in a Red Bull for the first time since the car appeared at the end of January.\n\nThe team had previously not managed to do more than about 20 laps in a row in pre-season testing.\n\nSpeaking before his disqualification, Ricciardo said: \"Two or three weeks ago I would have bet pretty much everything I had that we would not be standing up there.\"\n\nThe Australian was in a comfortable second place for most of the race but came under pressure from Magnussen in the final 20 laps.\n\nMagnussen was within a second of the Red Bull with five laps to go but Ricciardo was able to hold on to the end. Ricciardo was eventually disqualified around six hours after the end of the race.\n\nBehind them, Button was unable to close on Magnussen, but beat Alonso by jumping ahead of the Ferrari at their final pit stops.\n\n\"It's hard to believe,\" said Magnussen. \"It seems so surreal. The car was so much better than it has been at any point. I just had exactly what I needed the whole race. The preparation we have done this winter has been fantastic.\"\n\nWilliams' Valtteri Bottas was fifth after an incident-packed race in which he hit the wall on the exit of Turn 10 and broke a wheel, triggering a safety car period.\n\nThe Finn dropped back to 16th place but used the pace of the Williams to fight back up the field.\n\nForce India's Nico Hulkenberg ran fourth in the early stages after jumping up from seventh on the grid and passing Alonso on the first lap.\n\nBut the German slipped back to finish sixth ahead of the second Ferrari of Kimi Raikkonen.\n\nThe Toro Rossos of Jean-Eric Vergne and rookie Daniil Kvyat took eight and ninth places. The Russian replaces Vettel as the youngest points scorer in F1 history.\n\nDetails for BBC coverage of the 2014 F1 season\n\nVisit the BBC Sport Facebook page for a gallery of the best pictures from the Australian Grand Prix",

Along with a statement announcing Gossow\u2019s departure, Arch Enemy have also revealed the Agonist\u2018s Alissa White-Gluz as the group\u2019s new frontwoman. A publicity photo of the band\u2019s new lineup can be seen above.\n\nArch Enemy have been around since 1996, and Angela Gossow (pictured at the very bottom of this post) took over for the band\u2019s original vocalist Johan Liiva in 2000. Ever since, Gossow has been a pioneer for women in extreme metal while bringing Arch Enemy to a level of success the group had never experienced. With Gossow\u2019s departure from Arch Enemy, new vocalist Alissa White-Gluz has parted ways with the Agonist to focus on Arch Enemy full-time.\n\nWhite-Gluz will appear on Arch Enemy\u2019s upcoming album, \u2018War Eternal,\u2019 which will arrive in June. The video for the disc\u2019s title track will debut this Thursday, March 20.\n\nArch Enemy posted various statements on their Facebook page, including the initial news, a statement from Angela Gossow, a comment from Alissa White-Gluz and a final piece from Arch Enemy\u2019s Michael Amott:\n\nDear ARCH ENEMY fans, this is not easy to tell you\u2026I have decided to step down from being ARCH ENEMY\u2019s voice of anger. After 13 years of pure fucking metal, 6 studio albums and countless tours through five continents, I feel the need to enter a different phase in my life, be with my family and pursue other interests. I will however remain business manager for ARCH ENEMY, and I will continue to develop my artist management roster. I am staying true to my heavy metal roots, just leaving the spotlight so to speak. I am passing the torch to the super talented Alissa White-Gluz, whom I\u2019ve known as a dear friend and a superb vocalist for many years. I always thought she deserved a chance to shine \u2013 and now she\u2019s getting it. Just like I got that chance back in 2001. I want to thank all ARCH ENEMY fans, our labels Century Media (worldwide) and Trooper Entertainment (Japan), our dedicated road crew, and in particular Michael, Daniel and Sharlee for their love and support throughout all these years. It\u2019s been one hell of a ride! We conquered every situation, made it through thick & thin together in the most exciting and rewarding time of my life. Thank you all for being there with me on stage, in front of the stage, and backstage. You have touched my heart, and I hope I was able to give something back to you. I am grateful for the wonderful memories \u2013 I will cherish them forever! I am looking forward to the next decade of ARCH ENEMY madness! Right now I am listening through rough mixes of the new studio album and I am blown away! 2014 will see a renewed ARCH ENEMY at the top of their game. I am proud to be part of this ARCH ENEMY chapter, albeit in a different way \u2013 revving up the engines behind the scenes. I hope to see you in front of the stage; I will join you there this time. Let the killing begin, once again!\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very honored and happy to announce a new chapter in my life and musical career beginning now; I have joined forces with one of my all-time favorite and globally respected bands, ARCH ENEMY. \u2018Wages of Sin\u2019 was the first metal album I ever bought, and it was love at first listen. It is not often that you get a phone call from your favorite band asking you to join! I am thrilled to have the opportunity to work with such amazingly talented musicians whom I also consider great friends. I look forward to being able to write and perform at a whole new level now with ARCH ENEMY! Music is forever, metal is limitless and this is only the beginning!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are eternally grateful to Angela for all her passion, hard work and talent. Her legacy is tremendous and will always be a big part of the band\u2019s history. We feel great pride in what has been achieved in the past, but also look forward to new battles and new victories. We welcome Alissa with open arms \u2013 and we hope you will have open ears. We might have just created our most wicked metal opus yet with our upcoming album \u2018War Eternal\u2019!\u201d\n\nThe Agonist are also moving on following the departure of their vocalist, announcing singer Vicky Psarakis as the group\u2019s new frontwoman:\n\nArch Enemy will hit the road with their new frontwoman on May 23, while the Agonist promise new material with vocalist Vicky Psarakis coming soon.",

But their signature slogan was \"God hates fags\".\n\n\"You're not going to get nowhere with that slop that 'God loves you,'\" Mr Phelps once told the Religion News Service. \"That's a diabolical lie from hell without biblical warrant.\"\n\nIn 2009, Mr Phelps and his daughter were barred from entering the United Kingdom due to their anti-gay preaching.\n\nThe church's actions inspired a federal law and numerous state laws limiting picketing at funerals.\n\nIn 2011 the church won a major legal victory when the US Supreme Court ruled it could not be sued for monetary damages for inflicting pain on grieving families.",

Several of Phelps's children are lawyers.\n\nThe church won a major legal victory in 2011 when the Supreme Court ruled it couldn't be sued for inflicting pain on grieving families.\n\nIt first gained national notoriety by protesting at the funeral of gay student Matthew Shepard, whose brutal 1998 murder in Laramie, Wyoming sparked a nationwide debate about homophobia.\n\nChurch members began protesting at the funerals of soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2005.\n\nDaughter Margie said he died shortly after midnight Thursday. She did not provide the cause of death or the condition that recently put him in hospice care.\n\nHis estranged son Nate, who broke with Westboro 37 years ago, said earlier this week that that the church members had voted out the family patriarch and he was on his close to death.\n\nThe church, which critics described as a cult of personality organised around Phelps Sr, has a long history of excommunicating its members for perceived sins or mistakes.\n\nThe younger Mr Phelps said in a Facebook posting that his father suffered the same fate last August for an undisclosed reasons and that his health has since deteriorated as he \"basically stopped eating and drinking\".\n\nThe church was featured in a 2007 BBC documentary presented by Louis Theroux, called The Most Hated Family in America. Fred Phelps' daughter Shirley later said that her main complaint was that the programme was not entitled: \"The Most Hated Family in the World\".\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Centre, which tracks the activity of hate groups in the US, describes Westboro as \"arguably the most obnoxious and rabid hate group in America ... [and] basically a family-based cult of personality built around its patriarch, Fred Phelps\".\n\nThe church first gained widespread notoriety when it picketed the funeral of Matthew Shepard, a gay student who was viciously beaten and left to die tied to a ranch fence in Wyoming in 1998.",

He is now on the edge of death at Midland Hospice house in Topeka, Kansas.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how I feel about this. Terribly ironic that his devotion to his god ends this way. Destroyed by the monster he made.\n\n\u201cI feel sad for all the hurt he\u2019s caused so many. I feel sad for those who will lose the grandfather and father they loved. And I\u2019m bitterly angry that my family is blocking the family members who left from seeing him, and saying their good-byes.\u201d\n\nFred Phelps came to prominence in the UK following a Louis Theroux documentary about his family entitled The Most Hated Family in America.\n\nAs a consequence of the protests at military funerals President George W. Bush signed the Respect for America's Fallen Heroes Act into law in May 2006. In 2011, however, the US Supreme Court held that the church and its members couldn\u2019t be sued for monetary damages for inflicting pain on grieving families.\n\nBased in Topeka, Kansas, the church had also been criticised for broadcasting antisemitic and xenophobic views, and has picketed Ground Zero in the past.\n\nLast year the church vowed to protest at a One Direction gig on the grounds that they were \u201ccrotch-grabbing little perverts\u201d, and in 2009 Phelps, who was 84, and his daughter Shirley Phelps-Roper were banned from entering the UK to picket a school play.\n\nDespite the prominent media profile of the Westboro Baptist Church over the past decade, more than 20 members have followed Nathan Phelps by leaving the church.",

Last month, he tweeted a salon.com article by writer Jeff Chu, who spent a day at the Westboro Baptist church while researching his book Does Jesus Really Love Me?: a Gay Christian's Pilgrimage in Search of God in America. \"One more day at the Westboro Baptist church,\" posted Ebert.\n\nA statement on the WBC website (pdf) rounded on Ebert, pledging to maintain a presence outside the Holy Name Cathedral in Chicago and saying: \"American entertainment industry publicity leech Roger Ebert took to Twitterverse to mock the faithful servants of God at Westboro Baptist church, just days before he received the horrifying summons.\"\n\nThe WBC, which is also anti-Jewish, anti-Catholic and anti-Chinese, believes that the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are God's punishment on America for tolerating homosexuality. The group has demonstrated at military funerals across the US, regardless of the sexual preferences of the deceased.\n\nEbert's final review \u2013 on To the Wonder, the new Terrence Malick film \u2013 was published on Saturday in the Chicago Sun-Times, where he had been a film critic since 1967.\n\nIt was accompanied by a note from Ebert's editor saying: \"The following is the last review written by Roger Ebert. Appropriately it's a review of a film by a director Mr Ebert held in great esteem: Terrence Malick.\"\n\nTo the Wonder stars Ben Affleck, Olga Kurylenko, Rachel McAdams and Javier Bardem. Ebert, who gave the film 3.5 stars out of four, was in contemplative mood as he mulled the drama's opaque and \"elusive\" nature.\n\n\"A more conventional film would have assigned a plot to these characters and made their motivations more clear,\" he wrote. \"Malick, who is surely one of the most romantic and spiritual of film-makers, appears almost naked here before his audience, a man not able to conceal the depth of his vision.\n\n\"'Well,' I asked myself, 'why not?' Why must a film explain everything? Why must every motivation be spelled out? Aren't many films fundamentally the same film, with only the specifics changed? Aren't many of them telling the same story? Seeking perfection, we see what our dreams and hopes might look like. We realise they come as a gift through no power of our own, and if we lose them, isn't that almost worse than never having had them in the first place?\n\n\"There will be many who find To the Wonder elusive and too effervescent. They'll be dissatisfied by a film that would rather evoke than supply. I understand that, and I think Terrence Malick does, too. But here he has attempted to reach more deeply than that: to reach beneath the surface, and find the soul in need.\"\n\nThere will be a separate memorial service for Ebert on Thursday at an unrevealed location.",

Inflicting pain on others wasn't the goal, but it was one of the outcomes. We wish it weren't so, and regret that hurt.\n\n\"We know that we dearly love our family. They now consider us betrayers, and we are cut off from their lives, but we know they are well-intentioned. We will never not love them.\n\n\"We know that we can't undo our whole lives. We can't even say we'd want to if we could; we are who we are because of all the experiences that brought us to this point. What we can do is try to find a better way to live from here on. That's our focus.\"\n\nThe Westboro Baptist church gained notoriety for demonstrating at military funerals across the US, claiming the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are God's punishment on America for tolerating homosexuality.\n\nThe church has a small congregation, largely made up of the extended family of the Reverend Fred Phelps, the grandfather of Megan and Grace Phelps-Roper. Their mother, Shirley Lynn Phelps-Roper, is one of its most outspoken representatives. In 2007 the BBC broadcast a documentary on the church by Louis Theroux, which was billed as The Most Hated Family in America.\n\nAs well as picketing military funerals, the church also pickets sporting events, concerts and other occasions in the apparent hope of publicity. As well as being anti-gay, it is also anti-Jewish, anti-Catholic and anti-Chinese.\n\nIn an accompanying Medium piece, Damsel, Arise: A Westboro Scion Leaves Her Church, Jeff Chu describes what led Megan, who was named by the Kansas City Star as \"the future leader\" of the church, to leave in November.\n\nChu writes that her ephiphany over Westborough's hateful dogma began with a Twitter discussion with Jewish blog Jewlicious's David Abitbol. She came to realise the problems with condemning people to death, arbitrarily fixating on the \"sin\" of homosexuality and believing that the church had all the answers.\n\nThe church told the Topeka Capital Journal that it did not know the whereabouts of the two women.",

                "text": "The First Amendment protects a fringe church's anti-gay protests at military funerals, a nearly unanimous Supreme Court ruled Wednesday in a powerful opinion that spoke to the nation's tolerance for even hateful public speech.\n\nThe court's most liberal and most conservative justices joined in a decision likely to define the term. It writes a new chapter in the court's findings that freedom of speech is so central to the nation that it protects cruel and unpopular protests - even, in this case, at the moment of a family's most profound grief.\n\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote that Westboro Baptist Church's picketing at fallen soldiers' funerals \"is certainly hurtful and its contribution to public discourse may be negligible.\" But he said the reaction may not be \"punishing the speaker.\"\n\n\"As a nation we have chosen a different course - to protect even hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate,\" Roberts said.\n\nThe court sided with a group on the outskirts of American life: a tiny family church in Topeka, Kan., that has drawn disdain across the nation for its protests of military funerals and its lewd signs proclaiming God's hatred. Its message is that military deaths - and virtually any natural disaster - are divine punishment for the country's tolerance of homosexuality.\n\nAt issue was the protest in 2006 at the funeral of 20-year-old Marine Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder in Westminster, Md., who had been killed in Iraq - one of more than 600 funerals the group has picketed. His father, Albert, filed a lawsuit seeking damages, saying the group had turned the event into a \"circus.\"\n\nMargie Phelps, the daughter of Westboro's founder, the Rev. Fred W. Phelps, and a lawyer who argued the case before the court, called Wednesday's decision a providential ruling that was more than she had hoped for.\n\nIt could encourage the group to challenge some of the more than 40 state and federal laws that seek to protect funerals from disruption, she said in a telephone interview.\n\nAsked whether the decision would change the church's tactics, Phelps said, \"We're going to picket more.\"\n\nThe court's lone dissenter was Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who said the First Amendment does not convey the right to \"brutalize\" private individuals.\n\n\"Our profound national commitment to free and open debate is not a license for the vicious verbal assault that occurred in this case,\" he wrote.\n\nSean E. Summers, who represented Snyder, said his client was naturally disappointed and worried about other families who will be confronted by Westboro.",

                "text": "Fred Phelps and his daughter have been banned from entering the UK A father and daughter from a US church which preaches hatred of homosexuals have been banned from entering the UK. Fred Phelps and his daughter Shirley Phelps-Roper from the Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) had urged protests against a play being put on in Hampshire. Queen Mary's College in Basingstoke is staging The Laramie Project, a play about a man killed for being gay. Mrs Phelps-Roper told BBC News the decision would \"bring great wrath upon your heads\". She warned that other members of the church, who are not as well known to the authorities, would be trying to get into the UK to protest. \"There are members of WBC that are not named Phelps,\" she said. Cannot play media. Sorry, this media is not available in your territory. \"So they [the authorities] might have their work cut out for them. \"Unless they intend to begin checking the bare backsides of every person coming into that country to find that tattoo that says 'Property of WBC', they will have no way of identifying who is from WBC.\" She called the British government \"filthy\" for thinking they had the power \"to keep the word of God from coming into her borders\". The UK Border Agency said it opposed \"extremism in all its forms\". A spokesman added: \"Both these individuals have engaged in unacceptable behaviour by inciting hatred against a number of communities. \"We will continue to stop those who want to spread extremism, hatred and violent messages in our communities from coming to our country. \"The exclusions policy is targeted at all those who seek to stir up tension and provoke others to violence regardless of their origins and beliefs.\" The Westboro church's website advertised the picket, which was set to take place on Friday, proclaiming: \"In merry old England they plan to further enrage the living God by putting on the farce known commonly as The Laramie Project. \"We will picket them, and see if they actually believe those lies they tell about how tolerant and accepting Brits are.\" Hampshire Police said they were aware of the planned protest and officers were monitoring the situation. The church's pickets of military funerals have outraged Americans Stephen Sheedy, principal at Queen Mary's College, said: \"I have been amazed and disturbed by what has happened this week. \"[The church's views] are such a gross abuse of Christianity and a gross misreading. \"The show is being put on by a production company, not by our students, but we support it fully and hope it goes ahead without any problems.\" He did not expect any picket by the Westboro church but thought the coverage could actually spark a counter protest against them. Members of the group - based in Topeka, Kansas - have denounced homosexuality for years and have in the past targeted the funerals of Aids victims. In 2007, the church was told to pay $10.9m (\u00a35.2m) after its members cheered a soldier's death as \"punishment\" for US tolerance of homosexuality.",

                "text": "The Scottish Prison Service is to hire property consultants to find potential sites for a replacement to HMP Barlinnie which was described as grossly overcrowded in a critical report in 2011.\n\nHM Inspectorate of Prisons, which described many areas of the Victorian prison as woefully out-of-date, recommended that its future was reviewed.\n\nA specification list on a \u00adtendering document made \u00adavailable to companies interested in the contract states that potential sites for a prison, called HMP Glasgow, would have to be between 200,000 and 300,000 square metres in size, far larger than the 134,000 square metre area of north east Glasgow where Barlinnie, built between 1882 and 1897, is now.\n\nIt is acknowledged that finding locations that meet the criteria within the boundaries of Glasgow \"is not guaranteed\", meaning the new jail could be built in the North Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire, Refrewshire or East Renfrewshire council areas.\n\nThe Scottish Prison Service said it had previously committed to replacing HMP Barlinnie and that the project remained at a \"very early stage\".\n\nHowever, Labour MSP Paul Martin, whose Glasgow Provan constituency includes the jail, accused the service of behaving in a secretive manner over the plan and questioned how building an expanded prison was compatible with the Scottish Government's aim of reducing the prison population.\n\nHe said: \"As the local MSP, my concern is that there has been no liaison with the local community. I have never seen anything about a possible relocation to Renfrewshire. There has been no discussion of how the existing facility could be modified or any future development on site. If they move out, what do you do with a building like that?\n\n\"It's integrated into the local community, people have accepted it's there and it's a local employer. But if you're talking about a new build, people are not going to want it next door.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this is the way the prison service has worked. There have been a lot of occasions where they've taken a very insular approach. This is another example and it's extremely disappointing. I would call on them to go public with their proposals so a meaningful dialogue can take place.\"\n\nIt is understood that while the capacity of the new jail has not yet been set, it is planned that it will comfortably hold significantly more convicts than are in Barlinnie currently. During the 2011 inspection the prison, designed to hold 1000 prisoners, was home to almost 1500. On Friday, 1347 prisoners were being held there.\n\nThe firm that wins the tender will identify a minimum of three sites that could accommodate the replacement prison, before carrying out detailed investigations of the land and surrounding infrastructure. It may then be asked to drive through a planning application and negotiate purchase of the land.\n\nA Scottish Prison Service spokeswoman said: \"We have previously made a commitment to replace HMP Barlinnie as part of our estates development strategy. The project remains at a very early stage, but this contract is an attempt to identify a suitable site for the HMP Glasgow development.\"",

There were 199 deaths in prisons in England and Wales in total.\n\nMale prisoners' suicide and self-harm is rising year on year. In 2013, five male prisons each recorded three self-inflicted deaths.\n\nThe suicide rate among female prisoners has fallen, thanks to safety measures recommended by former Labour MP Lady Corston in a report published in 2007.\n\nHer report followed a sharp rise in female prisoners' suicides, including six deaths in Styal prison in 2003.\n\nStatistics gathered by the Prison Reform Trust indicate mental health problems may be behind the increase in suicide and self-harm rates: 26% of women and 16% of men were treated for a mental health problem in the year before custody.\n\nAnd 62% of male and 52% female prisoners are classed as having a personality disorder.\n\nCommenting on the rise in apparent prison homicides, Professor David Wilson, head of criminology at Birmingham City University and a former prison governor, said: \"This is the highest number of alleged murders since 1998 and it reflects deep structural problems about control and order inside our jails \u2013 not our most high-security jails, but every prison in which we currently lock people up.\"\n\nIn February last year, Subhan Anwar, 25, serving a life sentence for the murder of his partner's baby, was killed at Long Lartin prison, Worcestershire. Two prisoners are awaiting trial for the killing.\n\nIn the same month, four prisoners were charged with the murder of 25-year-old Adnan Rafiq, an inmate at Hewell prison, Redditch, Worcestershire.\n\nLast October, a prisoner at Lincoln jail was charged with the murder of Alan Goode. Goode, 73, was serving nine months for serial voyeurism after spying on women in toilets in Leicester.\n\nAnd in December a 22-year-old prisoner, Michael Hennesy, died from stab wounds at Lindholme prison, South Yorkshire. Two prisoners will stand trial for the killing.\n\nAn inspection report of Lindholme in the summer was highly critical of safety measures at the jail. More than a third of prisoners said they felt unsafe and inspectors said drugs and alcohol were freely available at the category C prison.\n\nFrances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said almost all the deaths in custody were preventable.\n\n\"The responsibility for an increase in the number of people who take their own lives in prison lies squarely with those who advocate putting behind bars more and more people who do not need to be there.\"\n\nA Prison Service spokesman said: \"We are committed to making sure prisons are safe and secure \u2013 this includes reducing the number of deaths and applying strenuous efforts to learn from each one.\"\n\nA spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: \"Every death is subject to an investigation by the police and the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman as well as a coroner's inquest.\"",

                "text": "One hundred and thirty years old this July, Barlinnie has seen generations of offenders \u2013 many from the same families \u2013 traipsing through its heavy doors. But what does the future hold for this crumbling, overcrowded Victorian prison? And, more importantly, the inmates who consider it a home from home?\n\nBARLINNIE at dawn on a freezing February morning presents to the world a forbidding aspect, the brutal silhouette of its vast Victorian halls suggestive of a factory from the Industrial Revolution, albeit one in which the raw material and finished product are the same: men.\n\nBad men, some would say, and no doubt there are people in Scotland\u2019s largest prison \u2013 the defilers of children, the tracksuited cleavers of flesh \u2013 to whom that old-fashioned word \u2018wicked\u2019 could be reasonably applied. But there are many other prisoners who, one might argue, are victims themselves \u2013 of poverty, of poor parenting, of drug addiction \u2013 and who have ended up here, in part, because of the family and area in which they grew up; most of the 10,000 prisoners who pass through the prison each year come from the most impoverished postcodes in Glasgow.\n\nThough it looms large in the legend of the city, the prison remains a mystery to most citizens. Unless you live in the north-east of Glasgow, you might never in your life see even the brooding exterior, except perhaps for the blunt chimneys and barbed wire glimpsed from the motorway and soon forgotten. To walk freely inside its yards, halls and cells is a rare privilege that feels rather like visiting a national monument. As governor Derek McGill puts it, \u201cThis is not just a prison. This is Barlinnie.\u201d\n\nMcGill is a silver-haired 57-year-old whose navy pinstripes set him apart from his staff of 350 uniformed officers. He has come through the ranks, however, and is far from aloof. For 18 months he has been in charge, and is as proud of his position as the \u2018Guvnor\u2019 mug on his desk suggests. He finds Barlinnie endlessly fascinating. \u201cRight,\u201d he says, \u201care you ready for a wee walk about?\u201d\n\nMost of the prison population is held in five four-storey halls, the thick sandstone walls darkened and pitted with age. At the front of each block is a tall, arched window; above each main entrance is a painted crown. Inside, the brick walls are painted white, and the first impression is one of space and light; long vanishing points and a blue sky visible through the high glass canopy.\n\nThe reception area is as hectic and cramped as the halls are airy. There are 74 prisoners leaving the prison for court appearances. Prisoners yet to be processed stare sullenly through the windows of the claustrophobic holding cubicles, known as \u2018dog boxes\u2019.\n\nA prisoner walks forward and has a metal-detecting wand swept over his body. Brian \u2013 a 37-year-old with pale jail skin, short dark hair and hollow eyes \u2013 is a veteran of the search process. He has been in and out for years. This time he has been charged with serious assault. \u201cI\u2019m in for defending my property,\u201d he says with stale defiance. \u201cI was attacked in my house, but because I\u2019ve had three previous convictions, here I am.\u201d\n\nHow does Barlinnie now compare with how it used to be? \u201cToo cushy,\u201d he says. \u201cToo easy for the cons. It used to be that you respected the screws.\u201d\n\nBrian is against having television in the cells. Some prison officers consider telly the best thing that ever happened in Barlinnie because it pacifies the prisoners, making them less likely to harm themselves and others. However, TV has also had a huge impact on the literacy of prisoners, which has knock-on effects with regard to rehabilitation and future employment. \u201cI couldn\u2019t read or write when I first came in here,\u201d says Brian. \u201cIf I\u2019d had the telly back then, I would never have learned. I\u2019ve managed to get a bit of intelligence about me now; not that you\u2019d think so, with me still coming in and out of here at my age.\u201d\n\nThe majority of Barlinnie inmates have been charged with or convicted of thefts, breaches of the peace, drugs offences, sex offences and assaults of varying seriousness, with a little over half serving sentences of between one and four years. The prison also holds, in a small segregation unit, or \u2013 colloquially \u2013 the Wendy House, a few prisoners unable to mix with the general population, including high-ranking gangsters. Barlinnie\u2019s intelligence unit helps officers decide which halls are the most appropriate to house particular prisoners; mortal enemies, rival gang members and those owing drug money to affiliates of dealers are kept well away from each other. It is similar to deciding where to seat bickering relatives at a wedding reception, albeit on a much large scale and with much bloodier consequences.\n\nThe familial metaphor is apt. Incarceration in Barlinnie is dynastic. The prison has been home from home for three generations of some families. One prison officer says his father worked here for 35 years, locking up the fathers and grandfathers of the prisoners now in his custody. There is a dismal sense of destiny about it all.\n\nMost prisoners are in their 20s. Just boys, really, in prison-issue jeans and red sweatshirts. Their cells, which measure about two metres wide by three and a half long, have bunks and glossy girly posters and are strongly redolent of teenage bedrooms; the small window, high on the back wall, is curtainless, but prisoners improvise with T-shirts and pillowslips, creating bands of red, white and blue or green, white and orange, depending on footballing allegiance.\n\nMany of the prisoners, perhaps most, will have been working up to Barlinnie, having first spent time in Polmont Young Offenders Institute. This is a grim post-industrial echo of the apprenticeship system. The young cons here are apprentices no longer; they are journeymen criminals whose scars mark their fraternity with that particular guild. That\u2019s one of the first things you notice here \u2013 the scars. They zig-zag across faces unmarked by age, and carve their way through short hair like contour lines on a map. One lad has a thumb stitched where his nose should be, having lost it to a samurai sword.\n\nNew prisoners arrive daily with cuts and bruises, but it is possible to get hurt in Barlinnie itself. Since April 2010, there have been two serious and 15 minor prisoner-on-staff assaults, plus 53 serious and 56 minor prisoner-on-prisoner assaults. Weapons have been fashioned from sharpened forks and screws; a favourite piece of Barlinnie hardware is a toothbrush with two razor blades pressed into the melted plastic. \u201cYou can tell a jail slashing,\u201d says McGill, \u201cbecause you get a great big thick scar on your face, too wide to stitch properly.\u201d\n\nBarlinnie\u2019s atmosphere is a curious mix of tension, resentful boredom, melancholy and gallus gallows humour. \u201cHaw!\u201d shouts one young prisoner, Paul, trying to attract the attention of a passing officer. Paul is serving 27 months for assaulting a policeman and wishes to discuss a change to the dinner menu. \u201cWhat\u2019s happenin\u2019 wi\u2019 thae square sausages? Thae links are gonnae kill folk.\u201d\n\nNot all exchanges are so amusing. In D Hall at lunchtime, a prisoner called James, a tall man with longish dark hair, becomes very angry all of a sudden. \u201cYou\u2019ve no got a f***in\u2019 warrant to hold me,\u201d he screams. \u201cI know what happened to my family and girlfriend in here. You\u2019re gonnae get me murdered.\u201d He is bundled into his cell and the door locked. D Hall holds prisoners with mental health issues. Mostly, they are not so ill that they can be sectioned, but not well enough to be safely out in the community, so here they remain. The governor points out one disturbing, shambling figure in particular. \u201cHe set himself on fire a couple of weeks ago, and when they went in to get him out he attacked two firemen.\u201d\n\nStevie Geddes, an officer in E Hall, says the job requires constant vigilance. Many old hands among the staff were young officers at the time of the 1987 riot, and though the Barlinnie regime is now far less confrontational, the memory lingers of how quickly disorder can escalate. \u201cWe deal with some of the most violent people in Scotland,\u201d says Geddes. \u201cThere was a member of staff assaulted in C Hall yesterday. We\u2019ve had officers with broken jaws and all sorts.\u201d\n\nViolence is commonplace in Barlinnie, only the severity varies. Anything can cause a fight; the illicit trade in merchandise, for example, inflates both the price and perceived worth of items that, outside of prison, would be considered disposable. \u201cA tenner bag of heroin in here is worth \u00a360,\u201d Geddes explains. \u201cThe going rate for a mobile phone is \u00a31,000. A Mars Bar to you and I is 40p; in here, it\u2019s high stakes.\u201d\n\nDrug use is rife. Prevalence testing suggests that 82 per cent of those admitted to Barlinnie are on drugs; on release, 10 per cent fail a test for illegal drugs. Narcotics get into the prison in various ways. A small bag of heroin may be passed from mouth to mouth during a visiting time kiss. Less romantically, a drug user attending court and believing that he is going to be sent to Barlinnie will often hide a mobile phone and as much heroin as possible up his back passage, a part of the body known to prisoners as \u2018the bank\u2019.\n\nPackages containing drugs also come over the perimeter wall, sometimes fired by crossbow or catapult, during daily exercise; if the prisoner for whom it is intended is lucky, he will be able to lift it before the officer notices. There are also prison officers who will bring drugs and other items into Barlinnie \u2013 either because they are well paid to do so, or because they are too frightened to say no. McGill loathes such betrayals \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t like it when they sell us out for the other side\u201d \u2013 and has taken measures to toughen up security screening of staff.\n\nA daily ritual at Barlinnie, a sort of profane communion, is the dispensation of the heroin substitute methadone. Prisoners who have a prescription before coming to prison continue to receive it inside at the same dosage. Barlinnie is the biggest single-site dispenser of methadone in western Europe \u2013 400 or so prisoners receive it every morning, adding up to around 8,700 litres (over 15,000 pints) of the green liquid each year. Prisoners are brought to the waiting room of the clinic ten at a time and each in turn goes up to the hatch to receive his dose from the nurse. After swallowing, each prisoner must also drink a cup of water. This is to prevent them from holding the drug at the back of the throat then subsequently hawking it up to sell \u2013 a practice known as \u2018the methadone spit\u2019.\n\nTalk to any random selection of prisoners in Barlinnie and the chances are that most will have become involved in theft or violence because of their addiction to drugs or alcohol or both. What you hear again and again is that prison, for chronic addicts, is a safe place. They can detox, get fed, stay alive for a while longer.\n\n\u201cJail saved my life,\u201d says David, 47, serving three years for head-butting a drug dealer. \u201cThe only time my ma could sleep at night was when I was in here. She knew I wouldn\u2019t be found with a needle in my arm.\u201d\n\nBig Mick, 42, used to be a security guard, but since his mid-30s, when he split from his wife and children, has been lost in drink. He has had 17 sentences for shoplifting in the last seven years. This time he is in for four months. He finds it impossible to stay sober outside prison. \u201cI see the pain it is causing my ma and da, but the only time I can stop is in here.\u201d When he is released, he intends to commit further crimes \u2013 and get caught \u2013 so he is sent to Barlinnie again. He is not the only prisoner who admits to this strategy. Statistics show that around 90 per cent of those prisoners currently inside will return in future. Some hardly get further than the three off-licenses at the bottom of the street.\n\nThe last prisoner to commit suicide here was on his 50th stretch and was only 32. \u201cI think he\u2019d just had enough,\u201d says Governor McGill. \u201cThey cannot break the cycle of offending. People blame the prison service for that, but we deal with them as best we can. I think we do a great job. Look at what we do with work, with prisoner programmes, getting people off their drugs, getting them to put on weight again. By and large, they turn their life around when they are in here. But what we don\u2019t do is go out the door with them.\n\n\u201cI know people will talk about a 90 per cent failure rate because the prisoners keep coming back, but it\u2019s not my failure rate, or the Scottish Prison Service\u2019s failure rate, it\u2019s society\u2019s failure rate because there\u2019s not enough outside the prison walls.\u201d\n\nBarlinnie is in many ways a microcosm of society, and its members have the same everyday needs \u2013 both physical and spiritual. There is a church in the prison grounds, a barber, a dentist and a gym. Services are held every Sunday and 250 haircuts are given each week. The widespread use of methadone, which dries the mouth and encourages tooth decay, is one reason why the dentist, Dr Kieran Fallon, is often described as the busiest man in the prison. The kitchen, meanwhile, serves up 1.5 million meals a year, including porridge, of course, and is staffed in large part by Chinese and Vietnamese migrants caught during police raids on cannabis factories.\n\nThe prison laundry, too, is staffed by inmates, specifically the sex offenders. The mainstream prisoners would not tolerate their food being prepared by the \u2018beasts\u2019 of the jail, but find it acceptable that they wash and iron their clothes. Also, according to the governor, they are simply very good at the job; there is, apparently, something in the psychology of a sex offender that makes him neat and fastidious. Seeing these pale, plump, watchful, hateful, sad-eyed men folding bedsheets is just one of the many remarkable, troubling things about Barlinnie.\n\nCome July, the prison will have been open for 130 years. Built to hold 1,018 prisoners, it has rarely done so, and is almost always massively overcrowded. There are, at present, around 1,500 prisoners in Barlinnie, most of them sharing cells built for single occupancy. The population is seasonal. Christmas and summer are relatively quiet. From August onwards, the number increases rapidly, and last year reached its highest ever level \u2013 1,786.\n\nWhen Low Moss prison opens on the outskirts of Bishopbriggs next month, it is likely to offer Barlinnie some brief respite, but McGill does not believe it will be a long-term solution. \u201cJudges know when Barlinnie\u2019s not full, and all of a sudden remand numbers increase,\u201d he says.\n\nThe 2008 Scottish Prisons Commission noted that high prison populations are more likely to \u201cdrive reoffending than reduce it\u201d and favoured community-based sentences over short jail terms. The result is that Barlinnie now has far fewer prisoners serving less than six months, but the prison actually has more prisoners altogether. It would appear that remanding a prisoner in custody, awaiting trial, is being used to take troublemakers out of communities for up to 140 days, without imposing the politically difficult short sentences. The significant downside is that there are so many \u2013 right now, around 550 \u2013 men being held in prison for quite long periods without having been tried for any crime.\n\nOvercrowding is a problem because it means a large proportion of the prison population cannot access work placements education, or many of the rehabilitative programmes that are supposed to help them change into useful members of society while inside. According to the most recent inspection, on average 70.4 per cent of the population is locked up in cells instead of being on purposeful activity. Prisoners can spend up to 23 hours a day locked up with a cell-mate \u2013 or \u2018co-pilot\u2019 \u2013 they loathe. Physical fights in these circumstances, prisoners say, are a daily occurrence.\n\nWhat, then, is the future of this Victorian jail in the 21st century? The chief inspector of prisons, while noting that the institution is well led and run, and drawing particular attention to the excellent care prisoners \u2013 often frightened and despairing \u2013 receive during their first night in custody, has called for its redevelopment as soon as possible. McGill himself believes that by 2020 the present buildings will have fallen out of use and a new prison built nearby. Barlinnie\u2019s own long stretch is, it seems, coming to an end. \u201cIt would be sad to see it demolished completely,\u201d says the Governor.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of history here. You could imagine them running tours. This could be the Alcatraz of Glasgow. I think even the prisoners would be sorry to see this go. Places like Polmont don\u2019t have any atmosphere. Barlinnie has got a lot of life.\u201d\n\nA lot of life and, despite the odds, a lot of love. By 5pm, there is a long queue for visiting. It\u2019s almost all women: dolled-up wives and girlfriends; sorrowful mums and grannies. One lad catches the eye \u2013 maybe six years old, cute in his crewcut and best tracksuit, walking round in slow, bored circles, heel-to-toe, swinging a key for the prison locker, familiar already with the rules of visiting. How many birthdays, you wonder, has his father missed, and how many to come? And here\u2019s the most dreadful question of all: will that wee boy, too, one day end up here or in whatever prison replaces it?\n\nBarlinnie, every groan and dirty stone of it, has a habit of weighing down the mind with such fatalistic thoughts. So, as fascinating as it has been, it is a relief to finally leave the prison and walk out into the cold dusk, a half-moon rising high and pure and free above those grimly iconic chimneys.",

                "text": "Scotland's largest prison, Barlinnie in Glasgow, is more than 50% over capacity, with about 500 inmates more than it is designed for.\n\nBrigadier Hugh Monro, the chief inspector of prisons, said this meant it could not be regarded as \"safe\".\n\nHe has called for more investment and a review of the management of overall prisoner numbers.\n\nIn particular he wants a review of why so many men who have not yet faced a trial are held in Barlinnie.\n\nIn his inspection report, Brig Monro said the number of remand prisoners at Barlinnie had risen by 28% since 2009, compared to an increase of just 5% in the overall prison population.\n\nHe said this increase had contributed to the overcrowding at the prison, which mainly caters for short-term prisoners from the Glasgow area.\n\nAt the time of his inspection, in May, there were 1,477 men in Barlinnie, which has a design capacity of 1,018.\n\nBy November, the number held had risen to 1,565, more than 50% over capacity.\n\nBrig Monro said this meant the jail was not as safe as it should be.\n\nHe said the churn of prisoners coming through the gates made it difficult to offer meaningful education, work or health programmes to help prevent them from reoffending.\n\n\"The prison has an operational limit for very good reasons,\" he said.\n\n\"It's about staff to prisoner ratios; it's about how prisoners can be searched when you're moving them about; it's about prisoners sharing cells which should be for only one man.\"\n\nHe was particularly critical of the health centre at the prison and the educational facilities with only three classrooms - smaller than that at Inverness Prison which caters for about 150.\n\nThe chief inspector's report said the opening of the new Low Moss prison in East Dunbartonshire in 2012 would reduce pressure, by creating 700 new places - but Brig Monro said money must nevertheless be spent urgently at Barlinnie.\n\nThe Scottish Prison Service (SPS) is looking at ways of upgrading Barlinnie - but its building budget has been cut by the Scottish government by 68%.\n\nBarlinnie's governor, Derek McGill, said there was nothing he could do about overcrowding as he must house all prisoners sent there by the courts.\n\nBut he said he was concerned at the increase in the number of remand prisoners.\n\n\"I think they are going up because there is an element of risk required to leave somebody in the community, and perhaps the judges are not as disposed to leave people in the community,\" he said.\n\n\"Perhaps they would rather take less risk and remand them.\"\n\nBut he revealed SPS was looking at plans to refurbish Barlinnie's education unit and reception area which have been criticised in several inspection reports.\n\nHe said overall the inspection report was positive, and recognised the prison was well led and run.\n\nBut he added: \"If we could eliminate overcrowding, we could do more with the prisoners.\"",

Mr Buck was in custody serving a prison sentence at the time of his death thus requiring an inquiry to be heard. Evidence was led on 18, 19, 20 and 22 February 2008. Miss Maria Kicinski, Procurator Fiscal Depute, presented the Inquiry in the public interest; the Scottish Prison Service (\"SPS\") were represented by Miss Gillian Martin-Brown, solicitor; and Mr R Bruce, solicitor, appeared on behalf of Miss Sarah Matthews, Mr Buck's former girlfriend.\n\nThe followings facts were relevant to the circumstances of the death:-\n\n[1] On , Robert Buck appeared at and was sentenced to a period of 2 years imprisonment in respect of a charge of assault. A further period of 376 days imprisonment was imposed consecutively, being the unexpired portion of a previous sentence on which he had been released on licence. Thus the total sentence was one of 3 years and 11 days. His estimated date of release was .\n\n[2] Mr Buck had been imprisoned in H M Prison, since , having been transferred there from H M Prison, Dorset where he had been serving a sentence. He was transferred to H M Prison, Barlinnie, Glasgow on . He had never before been incarcerated in Barlinnie.\n\n[3] Mr Buck had a lengthy criminal history and had previously served a number of custodial sentences. According to his mother, Mrs Sandra Buck, he had been in and out of jail since he was sixteen, mostly in Perth Prison. He was therefore accustomed to prison life and routine. He had served previous sentences without incident and had never before raised concerns that he might be at risk of suicide or self harm.\n\n[4] Mr Buck had a history of mental illness. At the time of his transfer to Barlinnie, he was suffering from clinical depression for which he had been receiving psychiatric treatment in Perth Prison. He was prescribed two forms of anti-depressant medication. He had a significant psychiatric history: his father committed suicide by hanging when Robert Buck was a young child. Mr Buck himself had a history of self harm, having previously been admitted to hospital following a deliberate overdose. He had a significant and long-standing alcohol problem and had, in the past abused drugs.\n\n[5] In January 2006 when on remand in Perth Prison, Mr Buck had been referred to the mental health team there and was receiving on-going support for depression before he was transferred to Barlinnie. His prison records from disclose longstanding mental health problems.\n\n[6] As part of the general admissions procedure, Mr Buck was assessed in terms of risk of self harm and suicide in accordance with SPS practice and the \"Act 2 Care\" suicide risk management procedure in force (known as \"ACT\"). Reception risk assessment was carried out when Mr Buck arrived at Barlinnie from prison on . This assessment involved three separate interviews.\n\n[7] The first interview was carried out by the prison officer Montgomery at the admission section. It was noted that Mr Buck was not currently subject to the ACT procedures, nor had he ever been assessed as a suicide risk during any previous period in custody. No information had been received from any other source to suggest that there were any concerns with regard to his at risk status. Office carried out an assessment of Mr Buck's behaviour, attitude and risk by asking a number of pre-set questions the answers to which were recorded. Of note were three of Mr Buck's answers: he denied feeling suicidal, he denied that he might harm himself but he said that he felt the need to be protected. Nothing of concern was noted about his demeanour or behaviour at that time. In particular, Mr Buck did not appear anxious or low in mood. He was assessed as being at \"no apparent risk of self harm or suicide\". No mental health problems were suspected at that time.\n\n[8] Mr Buck was then interviewed by two nurse practitioners attached to the admissions sections, one of whom was Margaret Mason. She, too, carried out an ACT assessment. Again, a series of standard questions was asked. It was noted that Mr Buck had received treatment for mental health problems; that he had previously attempted self harm or suicide but that he had no current thoughts of that type. Nurse Mason noted that Mr Buck had a significant history (father committed suicide by hanging himself, previous attempted suicide, alcohol and drug abuse, mental illness and depression) that reflected four of the predisposing risk factors acknowledged in the ACT guidance and that, as a transferred prisoner, he was in a situation likewise identified in the guidance as a precipitating factor in terms of risk assessment. It was also noted that he was suffering from paranoia and depression. In this connection, he had last seen a psychiatrist two weeks before in . It was again documented that he was on anti-depressant medication. During the assessment, however, he was able to sustain a conversation, maintain good eye contact and he denied any intention to do any harm to himself, all features that suggested he was not at risk of suicide. Again, he was formally assessed as at no apparent risk of self harm or suicide.\n\n[9] The third stage of Mr Buck's admission assessment was carried out by one of the prison medical officers, Dr Sethu Raman. He, too, saw Mr Buck and likewise noted his previous and psychiatric history, diagnosis of depression, history of alcohol problems and prescribed medication. He also assessed him in terms of suicide risk. Dr Raman agreed with the previous assessments that Mr Buck constituted no apparent risk of suicide at that time.\n\n[10] Because of his mental health problems as noted on admission, Nurse Mason referred Mr Buck to the multi-disciplinary mental health team for further support. No other action was taken in respect of Mr Buck's mental health. Although he was considered to be in need of further support for his mental health problems, no information about that was passed to the relevant residential staff responsible for his day to day care. His condition was not made the subject of a health care marker, a means by which nursing staff communicate to medical information about prisoners in need of extra support to residential officers.\n\n[11] It was not clear whether the medical case notes from Perth Prison had been transferred with Mr Buck and were available to those carrying out the assessments. Usually the medical records accompany the prisoner on transfer but sometimes they have to be requested and are forwarded later.\n\n[12] At his own request, because of feelings of paranoia, Mr Buck was placed on protection and allocated cell 3/36 in \"E\" Hall. This is the protection wing where prisoners are accommodated separately from the rest of the mainstream prison in what is considered to be a safer environment. Mr Buck shared a cell with one James Murray, also a prisoner on transfer from Perth Prison whom Mr Buck knew from outside and inside prison.\n\n[13] While in prison, it was usual for Mr Buck to keep in contact with his mother and his erstwhile girlfriend, Sarah Matthews. When he was in Perth Prison, he was visited regularly by his family every two or three weeks. He was in telephone contact with his mother two or three times a week and also wrote to and phoned Miss Matthews.\n\n[14] Mr Buck was finding transfer back to a Scottish prison difficult after having been in H M Prison Dorset. He was unhappy and unsettled in Perth Prison albeit he knew the institution well. Mrs Buck saw her son on the Sunday before his transfer to Barlinnie. That was the last time she saw him alive. He was in a very low mood and was weepy. He was crying and depressed and wishing that he were back in . He had expressed similar sentiments to Miss Matthews. He told her that he was not coping in .\n\n[15] Following his transfer to Barlinnie, Mr Buck did not contact his family for some time although Miss Matthews received a letter on 20 February. In that letter it was clear that Mr Buck was still coming to terms with his lengthy sentence. He wrote that his head was \"a bit messed up\" and that he did not feel up to writing. However, he appeared to have been looking ahead: he mentioned having put his name up for education and that he intended to go to the gym in the next few months to keep himself occupied.\n\n[16] Mrs Buck heard nothing from her son until she received a letter after about five weeks after his transfer. The absence of telephone calls was unusual. In his letter, Mr Buck said that he was all right and urged his mother not to worry about him. He said that he hated Barlinnie but he appeared happy to be sharing a cell with a friend whom he knew from Montrose.\n\n[17] Neither Mrs Buck nor Miss Matthews had any concern that Mr Buck would have taken his own life. He gave no indication of that. A police statement taken shortly afterwards from his former cell mate, James Murray, indicated that at no time in the three weeks when they had shared a cell did Mr Buck give any indication that he intended to commit suicide. Mr Murray was aware that Mr Buck was taking anti-depressants but said that otherwise he was fine.\n\n[18] During this time, Mr Buck was seen by the mental health team as a follow-up to the referral from his admission assessment. On he was seen by one of the mental health nurse practitioners, Donna Skelton. She carried out a detailed assessment of Mr Buck's mental health during which she had access to his medical records from prison. He had been seen by a psychiatrist in prison two weeks prior to his transfer. At that time it was noted that he should be reviewed.\n\n[19] At interview on 13 February, it was noted that Mr Buck was trying to adjust to Barlinnie. He did not attend recreation or exercise because of feelings of paranoia and therefore spent most of his time in his cell, watching television. He reported having difficulty sleeping, poor appetite, feelings of paranoia, low mood and feeling depressed but not suicidal. He presented as facially flat and low in mood but was able to converse and maintain fair eye contact and was appropriate and co-operative throughout the interview. He was referred to the high dependency unit (a smaller, quieter unit better suited to accommodate more vulnerable prisoners) but apparently he later chose not to pursue this option. He was to be reviewed in two weeks time.\n\n[20] Mr Buck's case was discussed at the following multi-disciplinary meeting of the mental health team on 17 February. As its name suggests, this is a meeting attended by representatives of various disciplines and agencies including health care staff (nurses, medical officers, psychiatrists, psychologists) social workers, the prison chaplain, addiction and other services. Deputy governors and, on occasion, hall managers are also present. Residential staff do not routinely attend these meetings. It is the hall manager's decision to pass on any relevant information to residential officers strictly on a \"need to know\" basis.\n\n[21] It is not known what was discussed about Mr Buck at that meeting. The notes of that meeting were not produced in evidence and were not included in his medical records. However, from the brief entry in these records it would appear that he was considered in need of further support. His case was to be reviewed in two weeks time.\n\n[22] As a follow-up to Nurse Skelton's session, Mr Buck was seen again on 28 February by Nurse Morrison, another of the nurses attached to the mental health team. On that occasion he appeared settled in mood though \"a bit flat\". He denied all thoughts of self-harm. He complained that he was bored. He was still not attending recreation or exercise but had enquired about work. Hs appetite remained poor. It was decided to refer him for relaxation classes and review in three weeks.\n\n[23] Mrs Buck received a phone call from her son on Saturday 2 March which was the day before he died. He sounded down but told her he was all right and that she was not to\n\nworry about him. A transcript of the call confirmed that Mr Buck's mood was low: he said that he was \"feeling really down just now\" and was not in the mood to write. He complained about being locked up 23 hours a day. He hoped to be starting some afternoon work and discussed when his mother could arrange a visit.\n\n[24] None of the residential staff who gave evidence remembered Mr Buck at all. They could not describe his daily routine, his mood or his behaviour or give any indication of how he had been coping with his transfer. The most they could say about Mr Buck was that he had not caused any problems or come to their attention for any reason. Accordingly, his exact movements on the day of his death are unknown.\n\n[25] What can be inferred is that he must have been alive in his cell when the first security numbers check of prisoners was carried out just before breakfast at about 0845 hours. Thereafter, it is not known whether Mr Buck left his cell to collect his breakfast or whether he chose simply to stay in his cell. There was evidence to suggest that Mr Buck's section was not scheduled for exercise that morning so it would appear that he spent the remainder of the morning locked in his cell. The next numbers check took place around 1245 hours, after prisoners' lunch and before hall staff were due to take their lunch break. Again, it is not known whether Robert Buck left his cell to collect his lunch (although autopsy findings confirmed that he had eaten shortly before death). It can safely be assumed, however, that all was in order when Mr Buck was checked shortly before that afternoon.\n\n[26] At approximately 1530 hours, cells were opened up to let those prisoners scheduled to receive medication go to the ground floor to see the nurse. Mr Buck listed as was due to receive his medication. Prison officer Neil Fraser went to cell 3/36 and on entering the cell discovered Mr Buck suspended from a ligature attached to the upper rail of the bunk bed approximately five-and-a-half feet above the floor. He was leaning forward in a crouched position with his head in a loosely fitting noose. The ligature was fashioned out of torn up bed linen. His feet were touching the floor with his knees bent. He was already dead.\n\n[27] At the time of his death, Mr Buck was alone in his cell, James Murray with whom he had been sharing his cell having been transferred back to Perth Prison that morning.\n\n[28] Officer Fraser immediately raised a \"Code Blue\" - an alarm that signifies an emergency associated with asphyxia (in other words, a hanging) and other staff promptly arrived to assist. Emergency services were called. Within a matter of seconds, officers Steven Martin and Michael Mulholland arrived in the cell. Together they supported Mr Buck's weight, removed the ligature and laid him on the cell floor. Thomas Cringles, the duty line manager also attended as did practitioner nurse Mandy Woods who had been at the nursing station on the ground floor dispensing medication when she heard the alarm. She immediately commenced resuscitation, administering CPR with the assistance of officers Martin and Mulholland. CPR was continued for some thirty minutes until the arrival of ambulance paramedics who then took over. One of the prison medical officers, Dr Jai Kural, attended and having examined Mr Buck pronounced life extinct at 1712 hours.\n\nCause of death and time of death\n\n[29] An autopsy examination carried out by Dr John Clark, Forensic Pathologist, confirmed that the cause of death was hanging. According to Dr Clark, the injuries caused by the ligature were typical of those found in prison hangings which were mostly the result of partial suspension. Pressure on the neck would have rendered Mr Buck unconscious within ten to fifteen seconds. Irreversible brain damage as a result of anoxia would have occurred within three to four minutes. Death would have supervined within about five minutes. Accordingly, to have survived, Mr Buck would need to have been discovered within that initial three or four minute period, the ligature slackened, oxygen given and his heart re-started if it had already stopped.\n\n[30] From the condition of his body when found and from the presence of partly digested food in his stomach, it would appear that Mr Buck died a short time - an hour or so - after having eaten and probably about an hour or two before his body was discovered. An exact time of death cannot be determined but it appears that Mr Buck died in the early part of the afternoon, probably sometime between 1330 and 1430 hours.\n\n[31] In the course of the Inquiry, attention focused on four areas of the evidence: the provision of first aid; the system for checking prisoners in their cells; the suicide risk assessment; and communication between nursing staff and residential staff with particular reference to health care markers. The first two areas were of little significance to the circumstances of Mr Buck's death. The latter two merit more detailed consideration.\n\n[30] As to the provision of first aid, none of the prison officers who were first on the scene was at the time qualified to deliver first aid. Officer Fraser had not been trained in first aid. Officer Martin had previously passed first aid training but his certificate had lapsed. In the event, both officers Martin and Mulholland chose to render immediate assistance by means of CPR. There was qualified assistance on hand within seconds of the alarm being raised as practitioner nurse Woods was on hand dispensing medication in \"E\" hall. She was thus able to commence CPR and supervise and instruct officers. Additional nursing and medical help together with resuscitative equipment arrived within a very short space of time and the emergency services were contacted and attended in accordance with SPS procedure. There can be no criticism in connection with the availability and provision of first aid. In the event, sadly, the matter is academic as Mr Buck was already dead when officer Fraser entered his cell and had been so for some time.\n\n[31] It would appear from the evidence that Mr Buck spent most of the day of his death locked in his cell. Accordingly, he would have been in his cell, unobserved and undisturbed, between the lunch time numbers check just before 1300 hours and 1530 hours when his body was discovered.\n\n[32] There was evidence that, as a direct result of Mr Buck's death, an additional numbers check had been introduced after the lunch break for those prisoners in the section not due to go to recreation. It is difficult to see why this was felt necessary. Nor was it clear what this additional physical check on prisoners was designed to achieve. All that was said in that connection was that it might allow someone who had harmed himself to be found sooner. Almost certainly, it would not prevent someone determined to hang himself in his cell from doing so. Given that death follows very rapidly in such circumstances, a fatal outcome might only be prevented were the numbers check to be carried out at a random time which happened to coincide with the moment of suspension. Accordingly, it cannot be said that an additional check would have prevented Mr Buck's death or that its absence contributed to it in any way.\n\n[33] Although the frequency of numbers checks had little relevance to the circumstances of Mr Buck's death, it perhaps is worth noting that he was alone in his cell at the time of his death, his cell mate having been transferred to earlier that day. Obviously it would have been difficult, if not impossible, for Mr Buck to have hung himself in the presence of another prisoner.\n\n[34] The SPS have in place an active risk management strategy known throughout the service as \"ACT\". This strategy was first introduced in 1999 as \"Act and Care\". The current strategy - \"Act 2 Care\" - was introduced in 2005 and was in force at the time of Mr Buck's death. ACT is not a suicide prevention strategy but is designed to manage the risk of suicide. It is accepted that those determined to take their own lives will find a way of doing so, even within the restrictions of a prison environment. It is likewise recognised that, to some extent, all prisoners are vulnerable to risk of suicide or self harm and that many already have predisposing factors such as mental health problems, drug addiction and the abuse of alcohol.\n\n[35] The ACT policy aims to foster a culture of care and support for individual prisoners as part of the management of suicide risk in prison. The ethos is of a supportive regime with the emphasis on multidisciplinary team work, information-sharing and the maintenance of clear and effective communication. Within that setting, staff are encouraged to build good relationships with prisoners, to listen to them and promote an environment in which prisoners themselves will feel able to approach officers if they are in difficulty and, particularly, if they feel at risk of self harm. Thus communication is regarded as a key part of the strategy. All SPS staff receive core training in ACT procedures which is supplemented by mandatory refresher courses every year. It was clear from the evidence that all of the SPS witnesses were fully aware of the ACT principles and felt comfortable applying them in practice.\n\n[36] Assessing risk of suicide is no science. It depends on many factors, not least of which is the experience and skill of the assessor. It is, too, a fluid concept which can change rapidly. For that reason, all staff are trained to recognize certain \"cues\" and \"clues\", the most common if which are noted in the ACT documentation as a means of guidance. Suicide risk awareness clearly forms an integral and on-going feature of the work of all prison staff. However, of fundamental importance of the ACT procedure is the initial assessment process which begins whenever a prisoner is admitted to the prison, be it directly from court or on transfer from another establishment.\n\n[37] An ACT risk assessment forms an important part of the admission process. These procedures are followed strictly and details of the assessment are recorded in pre-printed ACT documentation. The procedure involves three separate interviews during which set questions are asked with reference to the ACT documentation. Each interview concludes with an assessment as to the individual prisoner's current risk of self harm or suicide. Although interviews follow a set pattern and the questions asked are those noted on the pre-printed forms, in reality, of course, this process is supplemented by discussion, interaction and direct observation of the prisoner's presentation, demeanor and responsiveness.\n\n[38] ACT assessment can produce three conclusions as to risk of suicide or self harm: high risk, low risk or no apparent risk. ACT procedures are \"raised\" in the first two categories and there are immediate and direct consequences of ACT status being imposed. High risk prisoners are placed in specially adapted \"safe cells\" designed with certain anti-ligature features. Prisoners are dressed in special anti-ligature clothing and placed under fifteen minute observations. Inevitably, this involves a substantial encroachment on the prisoner's privacy and freedom and, quite properly, such a course requires to be justified. Those assessed at low risk of suicide are allowed to remain in their cells and to wear their own clothes but they are placed on hourly observations and may be subject to other restrictions.\n\n[39] There are no separate means of identifying those individuals who are potentially - as opposed to actually or currently - at risk of suicide or self harm. Notwithstanding the belief that all prisoners may be at potential risk of self harm given their incarcerated status, prisoners such a Robert Buck whose history, personal circumstances and current state of mental health predispose them to the risk of self harm must be considered to be particularly vulnerable. While exploring this issue during the Inquiry, it emerged from the evidence that there is a procedure currently in use throughout the prison service which might be of some assistance in the management of such prisoners. That is the procedure for producing health care markers, a means of communicating information between health care staff and residential officers.\n\n[40] In 1998, the SPS introduced a practice whereby health care markers can be raised in respect of a prisoner. This is a means of communication between nursing/medical staff and residential officers responsible for the day to day care of the prisoner. This arrangement was designed to highlight individual prisoners who might have need for additional support as a result of a medical condition. They are most often used in connection with physical illness where it is important for hall staff to be aware of the prisoner's condition in the event of an emergency (for example, where a person is diabetic, epileptic or asthmatic). A short care plan may be attached to the marker giving brief instructions, such as, to ensure that a diabetic prisoner takes regular meals. Health care markers are usually initiated (and cancelled) by nursing staff. They are delivered to the hall manager who is responsible for communicating the information to the appropriate hall staff. A copy of the marker and any associated care plan is kept with the prisoner's file and is confidential in that it can only be accessed by prison staff. Thus health care markers provide a valuable communication tool to ensure that prisoners who are vulnerable on health grounds receive the extra support or vigilance that their condition requires.\n\n[41] Less commonly, health care markers are raised in respect of mental illness. They are not, however, used in any sense associated with risk management of suicide and are entirely separate from the ACT procedure. Like physical health care markers, it would be appropriate to use a mental health marker to identify prisoners who are considered to be vulnerable and in need of extra support and vigilance because of mental ill health. In practice, they tend to be used to provide residential staff with explanation for behaviour which might otherwise be regarded as bizarre, disruptive or disobedient. As such they assist the officers in managing daily routine and maintaining discipline, while also providing the individual prisoner with the requisite additional support.\n\n[42] It became clear during the evidence that not all staff were aware of the existence of mental health care markers. Those who were appeared in some doubt as to the circumstances in which such markers would be appropriate. They tended to use markers to identify and explain a prisoner's behaviour rather than identifying a particular mental illness and a need for additional support. While physical health care markers were used to provide a means of communication between nursing staff and hall officers to share information about a prisoner's medical condition where that prisoner was considered to be in need of additional support, there was a distinct reluctance to use mental health markers in that sense. Confidentiality was considered to be an obstacle and was an issue about which several of the health care staff appeared less than confident. Moreover, the stigma attached to mental illness was another reason repeatedly given for not using mental health markers in this way. Referral to the mental health team was seen as the most appropriate way of dealing with a prisoner such as Mr Buck. The fact that there was no routine exchange of information between the mental health team and hall officers was not considered to be a problem.\n\n[43] Robert Buck's mental state was specifically assessed on no fewer than eight documented occasions. At no time was he considered to be a current risk of self harm or suicide and it's no time were ACT procedures raised as a result of any concerns by any member of staff. There was no suggestion during the Inquiry that Mr Buck should have been made the subject of ACT procedure at any time while he was in Barlinnie. Such decisions are matters of clinical and professional judgment and all those who dealt with Mr Buck carried out their enquiries diligently and professionally in the spirit of the ACT strategy. His mental health difficulties were noted, his need for further support appreciated and acted upon with a referral to the mental health team and appropriate follow-up. At the time of his death, he was in receipt of on-going mental health treatment and support from a specialist team and was in daily contact with nursing staff trained to watch for tell-tale signs which would indicate any deterioration in his condition. However, no information about his depression or about any input from the mental health team was communicated to the hall officers so that they might know that Mr Buck was someone who had been assessed as vulnerable and in need of extra support. A mental health marker would seem the appropriate means by which to communicate such information.\n\n[44] While the idea of using mental health markers in these situations met with the approval of some of the health care staff who gave evidence, it elicited little support from the hall officers themselves. They were not convinced that having this information would assist. On the contrary, given the high number of prisoners who might fall into that category, there was a fear of information overload. Prison officers preferred to rely on using their daily interactions with the prisoners as the most reliable method of providing support and being able to detect warning signs and changes that might alert them to the fact that a prisoner was in difficulty. Such reliance assumes that the officers are able to interact with all prisoners in their care and establish the necessary rapport.\n\n[45] Some prisons operate a system whereby prisoners are allocated a personal officer. There was evidence that this system is not operated in Barlinnie. There were, however, other sources of support available to prisoners including the prison chaplain and prison listeners who are prisoners who are trained by The Samaritans to talk to prisoners in distress. But the residential staff and the nursing staff remain of primary significance in recognizing a prisoner in difficulty.\n\n[46] A stark feature of this Inquiry was that not one of the prison staff remembered Robert Buck. That is so even though it might be thought that the circumstances of his death and the surrounding investigations at the time might have triggered some recollection of him as an individual. Nurse Skelton recognised him from a photograph as someone she had seen, but otherwise no-one knew him, remembered him or could give any information to the Inquiry about him except from documented facts in the prison records. It is, of course, accepted that prison staff deal with substantial numbers of prisoners and that there is a rapid turnover and throughput. It is unrealistic to expect that they remember all those who pass through their care. That is the reality of the situation. It is also the real context in which the ACT procedures operate. These procedures rely on communication, the building up of good relationships between staff and prisoners, the promotion of a caring and sympathetic environment where prisoners can approach staff with their problems, and importantly, staff knowing prisoners so that they can identify changes in routine, behaviour or mood so that they can be alert to difficulties and intervene. This is central to the ACT procedures. It is difficult to see how all this was put into practice as far as Mr Buck was concerned.\n\n[47] A mental health care marker might provide a means whereby nursing staff can communicate concerns about a prisoner's mental health to residential staff where it is considered that the prisoner is struggling and would benefit from additional support. Residential staff could then act accordingly and be more alert to the need to watch for signs that might suggest that the prisoner is in particular difficulty. It would alert the officers to watch particularly for the clues and cues referred to in ACT. Such a system might be helpful in the context of an over-crowded prison where it is difficult to develop a relationship with every prisoner and impossible to be alert to all but the most obvious changes in behaviour.\n\n[48] Neither the procurator fiscal depute nor Miss Martin-Brown invited me to make any findings other than formal ones in terms of section 6(1)(a) and 6(1)(b). Mr Bruce invited me to make a findings in terms of section 6(1)(c) that highlighting Mr Buck's mental health difficulties by means of mental health marker was something which might have prevented his death. However, having regard to the information before the court, such a finding would be entirely speculative and unsupported by the evidence.\n\n[49] However, the evidence did highlight some confusion amongst staff as to the use of health care markers in respect of mental illness and identified some misconceptions about issues of confidentiality and stigma. Although it was not referred to in evidence, it is of interest to note that a mental health marker had in the past been raised by health care staff in prison in January 2005. That marker (page 24 Crown Production No 3) was headed \"Health Care Marker: History of Psychiatric Illness\" and noted care plan in the following terms: \"If the prisoner's mental health is causing concern contact Health Centre or complete referral documentation.\" No doubt that information would have alerted residential staff of the need for extra vigilance on their part.\n\n[50] Given that there was a degree of confusion surrounding the existence and use of health care markers, that some staff appeared unsure about the issue of confidentiality and were reluctant to use such markers because of concerns about the perceived stigma associated with mental illness, the SPS may wish to review the current training needs of staff in this connection. Furthermore, given the circumstances of Robert Buck's death, the SPS may also wish to consider whether such markers should routinely be used where health care staff have identified a prisoner as vulnerable and in need of extra support by reason of mental illness. As a means of communicating these concerns to residential staff, such markers might provide hall staff with valuable information alerting them to potential risks of self harm as well as ensuring that these prisoners receive the additional support they require.",

I'm like, 'What the f--- are you talking about?'\" he said, laughing.\n\nBrockie called the late Bon Scott of Australian hard rock band AC/DC \"my favorite performer in the history of metal. He's the greatest lead singer ever.\"\n\nDon Drakulich, another founder of Gwar and one of its costume and prop makers, said he knew little about Brockie's death except that his roommate found the body.\n\n\"It's very sad, and I'm shocked,\" said Drakulich, who no longer tours with the band.",

                "text": "RICHMOND, Va. (AP) \u2014 Dave Brockie, who as \"Oderus Urungus\" fronted the alien-costumed heavy metal band GWAR during graphic and fake-blood-soaked stage shows for more than three decades, has died. He was 50.\n\nOfficers were called to Brockie's home Sunday evening and found the singer dead inside the home, Richmond police spokeswoman Dionne Waugh said Monday. Detectives don't suspect foul play at this time, and the medical examiner's office will determine cause of death, Waugh said.\n\nThe band founded in 1984 is known for its comically grotesque costumes, stage antics and vulgar lyrics. GWAR was nominated for a Grammy Award for best long-form music video in 1993 for \"Phallus in Wonderland\" but lost to \"Diva\" by Annie Lennox. It also was nominated for best metal performance for \"S.F.W.\" in 1996 but lost to \"Happiness In Slavery\" by Nine Inch Nails.\n\nRandy Blythe, the lead vocalist for Virginia-based metal band Lamb of God, fondly recalled Brockie's approach to humor in a post on the band's Facebook page: \"Right now, if I were to truly honor Dave in the way HE would do it if it were ME that had died, I would make a completely tasteless joke about his death. But I do not have the stomach for that \u2014 Dave would, but not me. He never put much stock in 'limits.'\"\n\nGWAR released its latest album, \"Battle Maximus,\" in September 2013 and recently toured Australia and Japan. Over the summer, the band held its 4th annual GWAR-B-Q at a small water park in Richmond and released its own canned craft beer for the occasion made by Cigar City Brewing in Tampa, Fla. The band had announced plans for its 5th annual event last week.\n\nBrockie remained a constant in the band that has had a revolving door of members, including lead guitarist Cory Smoot, who was found dead on the band's tour bus in North Dakota in 2011. He was 34.\n\nThe state medical examiner said Smoot, who had performed since 2002 under the name \"Flattus Maximus,\" died of \"coronary artery thrombosis brought about by his pre-existing coronary artery disease.\" But records showed that investigators found on Smoot a $5 bill with a white powder residue, a prescription bottle holding eight Oxycodone-Acetaminophen pills, a lighter and two empty syringes.\n\nMichael Felberbaum can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/MLFelberbaum .",

                "text": "There may not have been a more entertaining personality to hit the music business in the past 43 million years than Dave Brockie.\n\nThe body of the 50-year-old GWAR frontman \u2014 better known with his fearsome prosthetic makeup as \u201cOderus Urungus\u201d \u2014 was found in his Richmond, Va., home Sunday night. It was a sad and abrupt end for a larger-than-life personality that the band\u2019s legion of fans assumed would eventually leave this planet on a spaceship, not on a gurney.\n\nThat\u2019s because GWAR \u2014 with its legendary stage shows in which members dumped fale blood on the audience, as well as its epic backstory \u2014 carved a niche in heavy metal history over the last 30 years.\n\n\"Basically my job is screaming into a microphone and bashing a huge dinosaur with a long sword,\u201d Brockie told the Daily News in 2009. \u201cI am one of the blessed people that gets to do what I love to do for a living.\"\n\nAlmost immediately after the band first played in a cramped Richmond bar called P.B. Kelly's during the mid-\u201880s, critics took one gaze at the band\u2019s look \u2014 a bunch of art school students clad in outlandish rubber costumes \u2014 and dismissed the group as a gimmick. Until Sunday, Brockie had outlasted most of his critics.\n\nBrockie would be the first to admit GWAR wasn\u2019t exactly The Beatles \u2014 their musical catalogue includes songs like \u201cMeat Sandwich,\u201d \u201cSaddam a Go-Go\u201d and \u201cSlaughterama\u201d \u2014 but their lore captivated concertgoers for three decades.\n\nTheir legend has it that Ungus and his fellow alien raiders, including Flattus Maximus and Balasac the Jaws of Death, crashed on this planet 43 million years ago in the midst of unleashing a swath of destruction across the universe. After inadvertently creating the human race by having intercourse with apes, GWAR members then got themselves frozen in ice, only to be dethawed in 1984 to become a rock band.\n\nThough the band continued after the death of guitarist Cory Smoot from a heart attack in 2011, it\u2019s hard to envision their saga going further.\n\n\u201cWhen someone dies, a lot of the time people will say 'Oh, he was a unique person, really one of a kind, a true original' \u2014 most of these people no idea of what they are talking about \u2014 they obviously had never met Dave,\u201d Lamb of God frontman Randy Blythe wrote on his Instagram page.\n\n\u201cI can't think of ANYONE even remotely like him.\u201d",

I want as much community engagement as possible,\" he said.\n\nIn Question Time, Prime Minister Tony Abbott emphasised the draft legislation had not been finalised.\n\nHe said the Government was \"attempting to engage the community in this, as you would expect\".\n\n\"What we have proposed today is an exposure draft of legislation,\" he said.\n\n\"We will finalise the legislation and bring it into the Parliament in the budget session.\"\n\nThis week is the final week of Parliament sittings before it resumes on May 13 for the Budget, after a six-week break.\n\nThe Government wants to repeal four sections of the Act, including 18C, which makes it unlawful for someone to publicly \"offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate\" a person or a group of people.\n\n\"Those three words - offend, insult and humiliate - describe what has sometimes been called hurt feelings,\" Senator Brandis said.\n\n\"It is not, in the Government's view, the role of the State to ban conduct merely because it might hurt the feelings of others.\"\n\nThe Government wants to retain as an offence any action that would \"intimidate another person\" and create a new clause making it illegal to \"vilify another person\" on the basis of \"race, colour or national or ethnic origin\".\n\n\"To intimidate a person is to cause them to be fearful,\" Senator Brandis explained.\n\n\"That is an entirely different state of mind, it is an entirely different concept.\"\n\nBut his Opposition counterpart, Mark Dreyfus, says the Government has moved to narrow definitions and broaden exceptions.\n\nUnder the proposed legislation, \"intimidate\" is defined as meaning to \"cause fear of physical harm\" and \"vilify\" is to \"incite hatred\".\n\n\"This is an extremely narrowly defined protection, an extremely narrowly defined prohibition of racist speech,\" Mr Dreyfus said.\n\nHe has also pointed to a clause in the Government amendments that appears to allow vilification or intimidation if it is \"in the course of participating in the public discussion\".\n\n\"One could drive a truck through that provision,\" Mr Dreyfus said.\n\n\"It is a provision of such breadth that just about anything ... said in the course of a public discussion ... would come within this exception to the prohibition, meaning that what we're left with is something of very little meaning.\"\n\nBut Senator Brandis says the narrow definitions in the changes are deliberate.\n\n\"We think inciting hatred is the core concept of vilification,\" he told Lateline.\n\n\"Whenever one is dealing with prohibitions of what people are at liberty to say in a free country, in our view those prohibitions ought to be drawn narrowly rather than widely.\"\n\nLabor pressed the issue in Question Time, asking the Government whether holocaust deniers would be free to express their views under the Government's proposed changes, whether it knew of any ethnic community groups that supported the measures, and why it was a priority for the Government.\n\nThe Prime Minister accused the Opposition of attempting to play \"dog-whistle\" politics.\n\n\"The Leader of the Opposition is choosing to play politics and attempt to try to engage in a bit of dog-whistling on this issue,\" Mr Abbott said.\n\nLast week, Liberal backbencher and Indigenous MP Ken Wyatt told the Coalition party room meeting he might cross the floor over the Government's amendments.\n\nHe has cautiously welcomed the changes but says he will be consulting widely with his colleagues and constituents.\n\n\"It doesn't pass all hurdles,\" he told the ABC's Capital Hill program of the Government's proposal.\n\n\"I think it is a step in the right direction.\n\n\"I think the Attorney-General, to his credit, has thought it through, has come back with a proposition that we can consider, and then it'll go through a process eventually where it becomes the legislation that'll be debated in the House.\"\n\nSection 18C became law in 1995 in response to recommendations from major inquiries, including the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody.\n\nIts accompanying section, 18D, is seen by some as a protection for free speech, in that it allows comments or actions made in good faith and \"fair comment\" if it is an \"expression of a genuine belief held by the person making the comment\".\n\nThe Abbott Government promised to change the laws during the election campaign.\n\nIn 2011, conservative media figure Andrew Bolt was found to have breached the Act over two articles he wrote in 2009 about light-skinned people who identified as Aboriginal.\n\nA Federal Court judge found Bolt's articles would have offended a reasonable member of the Aboriginal community, that he had not written them in good faith and they contained factual errors.\n\nThe News Corp columnist has welcomed the Government's legislation.\n\n\"There should be no conflict between saying no to racism and freely speaking our mind, and this proposed change recognises that in large part,\" Bolt told the ABC in a statement.\n\n\"I've always wanted Australians to have the freedom to oppose all forms of racism, including the new retribalisation of this country, and always trusted Australians to use free speech - the safest of all sanctions - to put real racists out of business.\n\n\"This is not a debate about who is kinder but which course is wiser.\"\n\nThe Institute of Public Affairs has described the Government's move as a \"victory for freedom of speech\".\n\n\"While a full repeal of 18C would have been preferable, the Government's proposal goes 95 per cent of the way towards ensuring what happened to Andrew Bolt won't happen again,\" the IPA's Simon Breheny said.",

Section 26 says that this Act does not make it an offence to do an act that is unlawful because of this Part, unless Part IV expressly says that the act is an offence.\n\n(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), an act is taken not to be done in private if it:\n\n(a) causes words, sounds, images or writing to be communicated to the public; or\n\n(b) is done in a public place; or\n\n(c) is done in the sight or hearing of people who are in a public place.\n\n\"public place\" includes any place to which the public have access as of right or by invitation, whether express or implied and whether or not a charge is made for admission to the place.",

                "text": "Last month, Delph created a sensation at the Indiana Statehouse. After 23 House Republicans joined with Democrats to remove the controversial second sentence from HJR-3, the constitutional marriage amendment, Delph unsuccessfully attempted to restore it in the Senate. In doing so, he violated Republican caucus rules, and in a memorable press conference under the Statehouse rotunda publicly blasted Senate President David Long, alleging that he had conspired to keep HJR-3 off the 2014 ballot.\n\nThe prior weekend, Delph posted a series of attacks against legislative Republican leadership, the news media, and even churches in his district, which extends from Carmel to Zionsville and the west side of Indianapolis.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy biggest criticism is with the evangelical church. GraceCC, E91, College Park, Northview, etc...you all should be ashamed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Delph said on his Twitter account.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been covering Indiana politics since 1985, and cannot remember an officeholder castigating churches in his district.\n\nDelph is now up for re-election, and he faces a gay Democrat, J.D. Ford. Should Delph worry about his reelection?\n\nConventional wisdom is that Senate District 29 is a staunchly conservative district that the GOP will hold no matter what. Matt Zapfe, executive director of the Senate Majority Campaign Committee, points to 2006 when state Auditor Tim Berry (now state chairman) carried it with 58.8 percent and 59.8 percent in 2010. Delph ran unopposed in 2006 and won by about 7,000 votes in 2010.\n\nBut the district was redrawn in 2011.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlthough it is a Republican-leaning district, it does not appear to be overwhelmingly Republican or socially conservative,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tim Henderson of the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee, who puts the baselines at 42 percent Democratic, 2 to 3 percent Libertarian, and 55 percent Republican. Richard Mourdock lost the district to Sen. Joe Donnelly, not even cracking 40 percent in 2012. Supt. Glenda Ritz carried the district with 50.9 percent that year and President Obama lost it by fewer than 1,000 votes.\n\nSo SD29 is Republican leaning and is fiscally conservative. But it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the social conservative firebrand stature like some rural Senate districts have.\n\nWith Delph\u00e2\u0080\u0099s theatrics and criticism of churches in his own district, and having thoroughly angered not only Senate leadership, but many of his caucus colleagues whom he accused of jumping ship on his efforts to restore HJR-3\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second sentence, it raises the specter of an isolated incumbent. But groups like the American Family Association, Eric Miller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Advance America and the Indiana Family Institute will rally on Delph\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behalf.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see an opportunity with Sen. Delph\u00e2\u0080\u0099s district,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Henderson said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s created an opportunity for us that might not have been there otherwise. J.D. Ford has gotten a lot of people reaching out to him from all walks of life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI really think this will be the race to watch in November,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ford told me, noting that there will be no presidential or gubernatorial race on the ballot. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere will be a clear contrast between what I stand for and what he stands for. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not another race as clear as this race can be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFord said that being gay is only a small part of why he is running.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a part of who I am,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ford said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make 100 percent of who I am. I want to be a public servant and have servant leadership. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not what makes me a candidate for Senate. I am running on other issues.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe did cite HJR-3 as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cclear contrast\u00e2\u0080\u009d between him and Delph.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe in equality for all people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ford explained. But he is a supporter of mass transit and adds, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSen. Delph spent the past six weeks talking about HJR-3 and not really talking about the issues of District 29, which are jobs and economy. They want us to focus on the economy and getting people back to work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDelph, who declined to discuss his campaign, has a reputation as a hard-working candidate. He raised $86,319.25 in 2013 and reported $180,223 cash on hand. But as former Senate leaders Bob Garton, Larry Borst and former Indianapolis mayor Bart Peterson will attest, candidates with huge money advantages can be defeated.\n\nSince Delph\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rotunda press conference, Ford has described a significant outreach in various posts on his Facebook page. His followers on Twitter have increased from 50 to 600; his Facebook page went from 700 likes to 1,200. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s raised about $2,000.\n\nWhile there appears to be a potential opportunity for Ford in this race, he will have to build and run a very disciplined campaign. He faces a vigorous incumbent with a dedicated core group of social conservative supporters.\n\nBut this race could be interesting to watch.\n\nThe columnist publishes at www.howeypolitics.com.

                "text": "The battle for control of the U.S. Senate will bypass Indiana this year as it plays out in states such as Kentucky and Michigan. Still, the outcome of other states\u2019 2014 elections could have a significant effect on the Senate race that comes Indiana\u2019s way in 2016.\n\nSen. Dan Coats, the Indiana Republican who returned to the Senate in 2010, has taken steps lately that suggest he is seriously considering another run. But he has also made clear that life in the Senate minority is not something he wants to muddle through for much longer. And, of course, outside threats loom.\n\n\u201cHe has decided not to decide whether to run again until after the midterm elections,\u201d said Eric Holcomb, the former Republican state party chairman who took over as Coats\u2019 chief of staff last year. Republicans now control 45 of the Senate\u2019s 100 seats and have a decent chance of picking up more this November. Whether they can win control of the chamber this year, or at least set the party up for a takeover in 2016, is weighing heavy on Coats\u2019 mind.\n\n\u201cHe decided to run in 2010 so that he could focus on the big issues of the day,\u201d Holcomb said, \u201cand the reality is that the Senate makeup will help determine if that is possible in the short-term.\u201d\n\nUntil recently, the popular opinion among many political insiders in Indiana was that Coats was unlikely to run again in 2016. But several steps of late have changed that conversation.\n\nFirst, Coats hired Holcomb, who is based in Indiana and has deep connections within the GOP and a deep understanding of the state\u2019s political terrain, a crucial must for an incumbent who eked out a win in the crowded 2010 primary with just 40 percent of the vote. Then, Coats\u2019 office hired a laundry list of regional directors with ties to the party base.\n\nMeanwhile, Coats, a respected foreign policy expert who seems more comfortable in serious Senate hearings than on the campaign trail, has signed up to speak at a series of Republican Lincoln Day dinners this winter, in places such as Franklin and Clay counties.\n\nHis office has worked hard to reach out to party organizations and local leaders and activists. (Remember, it was former Sen. Richard Lugar\u2019s absence from such politicking that first inspired animosity toward him among many of the party\u2019s most faithful.)\n\nBut is this enough to guarantee Coats a smooth path to the nomination in 2016? Well, Republican primary politics are brutal these days, particularly for old-school types who don\u2019t always see politics as a winner-take-all game. Coats was the target of tea party frustration during the 2010 primary and, since then, he has irritated some within the hard-to-please movement.\n\nFor instance, a Lake County tea party\u2019s website labeled Coats a \u201cGOP turncoat\u201d last year for not advocating for a government shutdown.\n\nGreg Fettig, a Hamilton County tea party activist, said Coats has failed a purity test on issues such as immigration. Others complain that he doesn\u2019t engage in enough partisan warfare and that he recently supported a farm bill that drew criticism for spending too much.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not really in it for the fight,\u201d Fettig said.\n\nBut many others disagree and complaints about Coats, while out there, are simply not that loud these days. Plus, at a time of dysfunctional politics, Holcomb argues that Coats has won fans by helping to improve D.C. gridlock by arguing that while some issues must wait until after the elections, \u201cwe don\u2019t have to have another 2013 where absolutely nothing gets done.\u201d\n\nChase Downham, Indiana director of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group that has fought government spending, said Coats has voted with the group\u2019s positions 84 percent of the time. The powerful Club for Growth, a national organization that helped defeat Lugar in the 2012 Republican primary, says Coats in 2013 voted with it 75 percent of the time.\n\nStill, there are whispers within GOP circles that Coats could face a primary challenge. Fettig said state lawmakers such as Sens. Mike Delph of Carmel and Jim Banks of Columbia City have received attention.\n\nThere are others who support Coats but believe, at 70, he should step down and allow a new generation of Republicans to take over.\n\nNonetheless, there doesn\u2019t seem to be the deep reservoir of ill will toward Coats as there was during the 2010 primary. Even tea party critics note that Coats has reached out to them, and it\u2019s important to note that Coats is actually quite conservative.\n\nWill he run again? We\u2019ll see after the November elections. And, if he does, will he have to fight for the GOP nomination? The answer to that will likely come at around the same time.",

                "text": "When conservative state Sen. Mike Delph took to Twitter about gay marriage and ultimately lost his formal vestiges of power within the Senate Republican caucus, he gained something far more valuable in the world of politics: \"Name ID.\"\n\n \n\n The political lingo stands for public recognition \u2014 good, bad, beautiful or ugly, it all matters. Delph reaped it in spades last week, reeling in Statehouse media and Senate Republican leadership to keep him in the public eye.\n\n \n\n It started when Delph tweeted angrily about the demise of the gay marriage ban just hours after the Senate decided earlier this month to push back a public vote on the ban until at least 2016. The fracas ended last week, as Senate Republican leaders stripped him of his formal rank within the caucus and moved his seat in the Senate chamber next to the Democrats.\n\n \n\n While it might have looked like reckless politicking, the maneuver elevated Delph from a rank-and-file senator to receiving more attention than even Gov. Mike Pence.\n\n \n\n But simply getting that acknowledgement is not a guarantee of success \u2014 especially if it's highly divisive \u2014 said Pete Seat, an Indiana Republican strategist and former Republican Party spokesman.\n\n \n\n \"Name ID is important because voters need to have familiarity with who you are and what you stand for,\" he said. \"But it's not a guarantee of success. Just because they're familiar with your name doesn't necessarily mean they believe in the same things you stand for.\"\n\n \n\n Take the 2012 gubernatorial race. Candidate John Gregg's advisers often said it was a good thing he wasn't widely known in the state because it allowed them to build an image. But Gregg was late to the advertising game, and found himself washed out not only by his opponent, Pence, but also by a sea of advertising in the U.S. Senate race.\n\n \n\n Former Senate candidate Richard Mourdock had little trouble winning a Republican primary against Richard Lugar, in part because of Mourdock's own extensive work on the local fundraising circuit. Mourdock's recognition among the conservative base of voters was extensive, enough to knock out Lugar easily in the Republican primary.\n\n \n\n When the general election got underway, Mourdock had little name recognition with the broader populace, something Democrats immediately used to their benefit with a barrage of negative advertising. But by the time Mourdock let slip a statement concerning God, rape and abortion just a couple of weeks before Election Day, his brand had already been defined.\n\n \n\n Delph has declined comment about his Twitter battle and the sanctions levied against him by Senate Republicans. But in a Statehouse news conference last week \u2014 a rare occurrence for individual state senators \u2014 said he was whipping up a media storm in order to protect the definition of marriage being between one man and one woman.\n\n \n\n Asked why he was making his arguments on social media and to reporters instead of the Senate chamber, where he was silent during the week of the marriage debate, Delph only said he was respecting the Republican caucus' code of silence about internal debates.\n\n \n\n Delph has not said if he has aspirations for higher office. He's filed for re-election to the state Senate this year and missed perhaps his best chance to run for Congress in 2012 after his political mentor, former U.S. Rep. Dan Burton, retired.\n\n \n\n But maintaining a strong base of name recognition is not always about winning the current election. It's often good for any future race.",

                "text": "(CNN) -- Japan and the United States have co-signed an agreement to remove and dispose of hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium (HEU) and separated plutonium from the Asian nation.\n\nThe fissile material will be transported from the Fast Critical Assembly (FCA) at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) in Japan to a \"secure facility\" in the United States, according to a statement released by the White House, and \"fully converted into less sensitive forms.\"\n\n\"This pledge complements the significant role that both Japan and the United States are playing in finding new ways to continue improving global nuclear security ... Japan has demonstrated its leadership by resolving to remove all special nuclear material from the FCA.\n\n\"Our two countries encourage others to consider what they can do to further HEU and plutonium minimization.\"\n\nThe U.S. has a longstanding goal of reducing -- and safeguarding -- the world's stockpile of fissile material, in an effort to reduce access by terrorist groups, criminals and \"unauthorized actors.\"\n\nThe deal comes at a time when the U.S. hopes to persuade Iran to halt their enrichment program, and tensions on the Korean Peninsula are hightened by North Korea's nuclear weapons program.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Barack Obama announced the deal this week at the 2014 Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague.\n\nIt allows for over 700 lb (315 kg) of weapons-grade nuclear material to be transported and \"downblended\" into safer material in the United States. The fuel, which was purchased from the U.S. in the 1960s, has been used by the JAEA for research purposes.\n\nThe agreed-upon amount which will head to the United States is a fraction of Japan's overall plutonium holdings.\n\n\"This is the biggest commitment to remove fissile materials in the history of the summit process that President Obama launched,\" Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall of the National Security Council told the New York Times. \"It is a demonstration of Japan's shared leadership on nonproliferation.\"\n\nPreviously in favor of refinement of fuel for use it its own domestic nuclear power grid, the agreement comes at a time when many Japanese nuclear power facilities have been mothballed, following the 2011 reactor meltdown in Fukushima. The accident, which occurred when a powerful tsunami damaged the facility, was the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.\n\nBeijing has previously criticized Tokyo's stockpiling of nuclear material -- suggesting that it had the capability to produce nuclear weapons relatively quickly. However, as history's only victim of atomic warfare, Japan's post-war constitution forbids the pursuance of nuclear weapons, with public opinion also overwhelmingly against the policy.\n\nJapanese senior nationals security adviser Yosuke Isozaki told the Japan Times that \"Japan shares a vision of a world without nuclear weapons.\"\n\nThe U.S. hopes to convince more nations to use reprocessing and enrichment facilities in existing nuclear states in an effort to minimize proliferation risks.",

                "text": "A state law regulating the use of drugs prescribed in medical abortions would put unfair obstacles in the paths of women seeking abortions, opponents of the law argued in federal court in Tucson on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt will prevent some women from having an abortion all together and will impose medical risks,\u201d said Alice Clapman\ufeff, an attorney for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, one of the plaintiffs in the case.\n\nClapman was in U.S. District Court in Tucson arguing before District Judge David C. Bury\ufeff, seeking to have the implementation of an Arizona law halted pending a court challenge.\n\nThe law in question, passed in 2012 and scheduled to take effect April 1, would require abortion providers who offer medical abortions to use the drugs only in the FDA-approved manner or as described on product labeling.\n\nThe most common form of medical abortion uses a two-drug protocol of mifepristone and misoprostol. The second of the two, when used in medical abortions, is done so in an \u201coff label\u201d manner.\n\nIn effect, the drug is given at a much higher dosage than indicated on the label. The so-called \u201coff label\u201d use of drugs already under FDA approval is common and typically legal.\n\nThe law also would require women to take both drugs at the abortion clinic. Plaintiffs say this presents an obstacle because the drugs are taken over the course of days.\n\nClapman argued requiring only the labeled use of the drug could endanger the health of women because cases have occurred where some abortions weren\u2019t effectively terminated when women used the lower dosage.\n\nWhen that has occurred, some women required a surgical abortion to complete the process, causing additional health risks, she argued. Medical abortions are done in the first trimester of pregnancy.\n\nIn his comments, Bury said the right to abortion would remain intact even if the law went into effect, noting the Constitution protects the right to have an abortion but doesn\u2019t protect specific methods.\n\nClapman said the law would place additional burdens on women seeking abortions, forcing many to undergo unwanted surgical abortions.\n\nThe law would impose an especially difficult burden on women in rural parts of the state, like Northern Arizona where there is only one abortion provider, Clapman said.\n\nFor those and other reasons, the plaintiffs want Bury to temporarily stop the law\u2019s implementation.\n\nMike Tryon\ufeff, with the Arizona Attorney General\u2019s Office, said the law was intended to protect women\u2019s health and would not prevent the practice of medical abortion.\n\nIn court filings, the state argued the regulations passed in the law fall under its obligations to protect the health of the public.\n\nWhat the plaintiffs describe as burdens to getting an abortion would be no more than \u201cinconveniences,\u201d Tryon said.\n\nHe also said the plaintiffs appear to be shopping for judges more amenable to their views on abortion rights than those they have found in other regions.\n\n\u201cThey are here to find a better audience in the 9th Circuit (Court of Appeals, which includes Arizona),\u201d Tryon said.\n\nBury did not rule Wednesday on Planned Parenthood\u2019s request for injunctive relief.\n\nHis ruling is expected before April 1, when the law is scheduled to take effect.",

                "text": "TUCSON, AZ - New rules that would block many women in Arizona from having pill-induced abortions are getting a closer look by a federal judge who will decide whether to put the restrictions on hold as a legal challenge plays out in the courts.\n\nJudge David C. Bury will hear oral arguments Wednesday in Tucson and likely decide on whether or not to grant a request for a temporary injunction by Planned Parenthood Arizona and the private abortion clinic Tucson Women's Center, who say the rules are unconstitutional and severely infringe on a woman's ability to have an abortion.\n\nThe rules released in January by the Arizona Department of Health Services are set to take effect Tuesday. The restrictions ban women from taking the most common abortion-inducing drug -- RU-486 -- after the seventh week of pregnancy. Existing rules allow women to take the pill through nine weeks of pregnancy.\n\nPlanned Parenthood says the change will unnecessarily force women to undergo surgical abortions. The group estimates that 800 women would have had to get surgical abortions in 2012 if the rules were in effect then.\n\nThe Arizona Legislature in the past few years has approved a number of aggressive anti-abortion measures. A House of Representatives-approved bill that is being considered by the Senate would allow for surprise, warrantless inspections of abortion clinics. Proponents of the bill say it protects women from clinics that are not up to health standards. Opponents say it puts women at risk and violates their privacy.\n\nWhen the new rules were announced in January, abortion rights groups said the limits on using the drug mifepristone, commonly called RU-486, were the most problematic. The Arizona rules limit it to use under the Food and Drug Administration drug label approved in 2000, which uses a much higher dosage. That dosage is no longer routinely followed because doctors have found much lower dosages are just as effective when combined with a second drug.\n\nThe rules require that the drug be administered only at the FDA-approved dosage no later than seven weeks into a pregnancy instead of nine weeks, and that both doses be taken at the clinic. The usual dose is lower and now usually taken at home, decreasing the cost and chance of complications.\n\nOhio and Texas have similar laws requiring the use of only FDA-approved protocols for drug-abortions that have been upheld by federal courts. But state courts in Oklahoma and North Dakota have blocked similar rules.\n\nThe Center for Arizona Policy, a powerful anti-abortion group that pushed the 2012 law, has pushed a series of anti-abortion bills that have become law. Two of those, a ban on Medicaid money for any of Planned Parenthood non-abortion services and a ban on abortion after 20 weeks, have been blocked by federal courts.",

                "text": "Arguing that new rules governing the use of abortion medication are a burdensome restriction to the rights of women in Arizona, lawyers from Planned Parenthood presented their case before a federal judge in Tucson on Wednesday morning.\n\nU.S. District Judge David C. Bury presided over the hearing at the Evo A. DeConcini U.S. Courthouse, 205 W. Congress St.\n\nAt the heart of the case is how doctors prescribe the medication RU-486. New rules, created by a controversial 2012 abortion bill, will come into effect next Tuesday. Planned Parenthood is seeking an injunction to halt the rules from taking effect.\n\nOften called the \"abortion pill,\" the medication has been widely used since 2000 after approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However in the last 15 years, doctors have adjusted how they prescribe the medication, giving a lower dose and allowing for the use of a second round of medication at home. Doctors have prescribed the medication up to the ninth week of pregnancy, beyond the seven weeks laid out in the original FDA guidelines.\n\nThe Arizona law, however, would require doctors to go back to the original FDA recommendations, creating an unnecessary hardship for hundreds of women in the state, according the Alice Clapman, a lawyer with Planned Parenthood.\n\n\"This would present an undue burden,\" said Clapman during arguments before Bury. Limiting the use of the medication would require more surgical procedures, something some women fear and could entail its own risks.\n\n\"This isn't about women's health,\" she said, \"and there is no dispute that the current regimen has the lowest risk to women.\"\n\nAssistant Attorney General Michael Tyron challenged this, arguing that Planned Parenthood has been \"experimenting with the protocols.\"\n\n\"They claim that their current protocol is safest thing in the world, but the FDA hasn't approved it,\" he said.\n\n\"There is no way that anyone could look at this could claim that this has been untested,\" said Clapman. \"Over 700,000 women have done this and the protocol been studied in peer-reviewed journals.\"\n\nThe judge listened to arguments for just over an hour, at one point asking how a possible injunction would affect both sides.\n\nClapman argued that dozens of women, already scheduled to receive abortions would have to wait. Tyron argued that the state would pursue another hearing, and need time to build a case, but could present more evidence including an expert witnesses.\n\n\"They filed this at the last moment to put us in a corner,\" said Tyron.\n\nBury did not offer a decision, but is poised to issue a ruling on the request for an injunction before the law takes effect Tuesday.\n\nArizona follows four other states that have attempted similar legislation. Ohio and Texas were successful after challenges in federal court, but state courts in Oklahoma and North Dakota have blocked similar measures.\n\nAccording to the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \"off-label\" use is appropriate and both groups have challenged Arizona's law.\n\nRU-486, known as mifepristone, is a different drug than the Plan B \"morning-after pill,\" although the two drugs are commonly confused. Plan B contains a higher dose of the same hormones found in regular oral contraceptives.",

                "text": "This story was updated at 11:25 p.m. EDT.\n\nThree new crewmembers have finally made it to the International Space Station, two days later than originally planned.\n\nA Russian Soyuz spacecraft carrying NASA astronaut Steve Swanson and cosmonauts Alexander Skvortsov and Oleg Artemyev docked with the orbiting lab at 7:53 p.m. EDT (2353 GMT) Thursday (March 27), as the two spacecraft cruised over southern Brazil. The hatch linking the two vehicles opened at 10:35 p.m. EDT Thursday, NASA officials said.\n\nThe three spaceflyers blasted off Tuesday afternoon EDT (March 25) and were slated to arrive at the station just six hours later. But the Soyuz failed to complete one of the automated burns required to pull off this \"fast track\" trip, forcing mission controllers to revert to a more traditional two-day chase and rendezvous. [ ]\n\nAll systems on the Soyuz now appear to be functioning normally, NASA officials said in an update Wednesday (March 26).\n\nThe arrival of Swanson, Skvortsov and Artemyev brings the space station back up to its full complement of six crewmembers. The newcomers join NASA's Rick Mastracchio, Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata and cosmonaut Mikhail Tyurin, rounding out the current Expedition 39 aboard the orbiting lab.\n\nMastracchio, Expedition 39 commander Wakata and Tyurin had had the $100 billion station all to themselves since March 10, when another Soyuz capsule ferried a Russian-U.S. crew back down to Earth.\n\nToday's docking marked the beginning of Swanson's first long-duration stay aboard the International Space Station, though he has seen the inside of the complex twice before. He visited during two-week space shuttle missions, once in 2007 and again in 2009.\n\nSkvortsov has one spaceflight under his belt, staying on the station for six months back in 2010. Artemyev, on the other hand, is an orbital newbie, though he did participate in the Mars500 mock Mars mission, which isolated participants here on Earth for 17 months to simulate the stresses and rigors of an actual Red Planet mission.\n\nThe space station will get another visitor soon. SpaceX aims to launch its unmanned Dragon capsule sometime next month, kicking off the company's third contracted cargo mission to the orbiting lab for NASA. SpaceX holds a $1.6 billion deal to make 12 such flights for the agency.\n\nThe Dragon launch was originally scheduled for Sunday (March 30) but was pushed after a fire knocked out a key piece of the U.S. Air Force's rocket-tracking infrastructure along the East Coast. No new liftoff date had been announced as of Thursday.\n\nSoyuz flights have historically taken two days to reach the International Space Station. Mission controllers introduced the fast-track route in 2013, allowing all the required maneuvers to be completed in just six hours.\n\nFollow Mike Wall on Twitter @michaeldwall and Google+.

                "text": "\"Sasha, congratulations to you and your crew on having successfully completed the first part of your mission,\" Oleg Ostapenko, director of Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, radioed in interpreted remarks. Cryptically, he added: \"Now, you know, there's been a well-kept secret promise that will need to be materialized, and we're not going to be making it too well known, but you know what you need to do.\"\"You bet,\" Skvortsov replied.A few moments later, latches engaged to firmly lock the Soyuz in place. After extensive leak checks, Skvortsov, flight engineer Oleg Artemyev and NASA astronaut Steven Swanson opened the main hatch and floated into the station, welcomed aboard by Expedition 39 commander Koichi Wakata, Mikhail Tyurin and Rick Mastracchio.All six crew members then gathered in the Zvezda command module for a traditional post-docking radio chat with space agency managers, friends and family members at the Russian flight control center near Moscow.\"We had a fun time,\" Swanson told his family. \"It was a long two days, but we made it. Glad to be here.\"Swanson's father called up, saying \"I'm happy that you're there even though you took the scenic route to arrive.\"\"We're anticipating you having a very successful six months, and I'm glad to see you're with a lot of friends ... and I'm sure you'll accomplish many things,\" Stanley Swanson said. \"Looking forward to seeing you back on the ground.\"Bill Gerstenmaier, director of space operations at NASA Headquarters, closed out the session, telling the crew \"the ground teams are here ready to support your expedition, we're looking forward to making your stay happy.\"\"I can tell you all your family will be here supporting you every day that you're in space,\" he said. \"So have a great time.\"After a safety briefing, Skvortsov, Artemyev and Swanson planned to settle in, looking forward to a bit of time off after a busy, unexpected two-day rendezvous. U.S. flight controllers, meanwhile, planned to press ahead with work to load new software into the station's computer system.The station crew originally expected to take delivery of a commercial SpaceX cargo ship next Wednesday, but the launching, planned for Sunday, was put on hold because of presumed problems with U.S. Air Force tracking equipment. A new launch date has not yet been announced.Skvortsov, Artemyev and Swanson blasted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Tuesday. Shortly after reaching orbit, the spacecraft's computer began executing a planned six-hour, four-orbit rendezvous, a procedure requiring a series of carefully timed rocket firings to home in on the space station.The first two rocket firings went smoothly, but the spacecraft was slightly out of attitude, or orientation, for the third \"burn\" and the rendezvous procedure was aborted.During subsequent passes over Russian ground stations, engineers downlinked stored data from the spacecraft to figure out what caused the 1-degree attitude error. They have not yet revealed the presumed root cause, but NASA officials say the problem is understood and engineers have developed procedures to make sure it isn't repeated on future flights.In the meantime, flight controllers began implementing backup plans for a 48-hour, 34-orbit rendezvous. Such two-day Soyuz rendezvous plans were the norm for most of the space station's 15-year lifetime and Skvortsov flew one during his first flight to the outpost in 2010.The shorter four-orbit rendezvous was designed to reduce the time crews have to spend in the cramped Soyuz en route to the space station. The abbreviated rendezvous was first tested in 2012 with an uncrewed Progress cargo ship. After additional test flights, four crewed Soyuz flights followed the fast-track trajectory. Skvortsov's crew would have been the fifth.With the station's crew back up to six, the astronauts and cosmonauts face a full slate of research activity, along with the expected arrival of three cargo ships over the next several weeks -- the SpaceX Dragon capsule, a Russian Progress freighter and an Orbital Sciences Corp. Cygnus cargo ship. Because of the SpaceX delay, however, launch dates are under review and have not yet been finalized.Wakata and his two crewmates have had the station to themselves since March 11 when Soyuz TMA-10M commander Oleg Kotov, Sergey Ryazanskiy and Mike Hopkins returned to Earth. Wakata and his crewmates are scheduled to follow suit in their Soyuz TMA-11M ferry craft on May 13. At that point, Swanson will take over as commander of Expedition 40.That will clear the way for the May 28 launch of Soyuz TMA-13M commander Maxim Suraev, a Russian space veteran, and two rookies: European Space Agency astronaut Alexander Gerst and NASA astronaut Reid Wiseman.Skvortsov, Swanson and Artemyev are scheduled to return to Earth on Sept. 11. Their replacements -- Barry Wilmore, Alexander Samokutyaev and Elena Serova -- are scheduled for launch Sept. 26. They will join Suraev, Gerst and Wiseman as part of the Expedition 41 crew.",

The Sumatran rhino numbers no more than a hundred animals in the wild, almost all of them on the Indonesian island of Sumatra (see map), and is possibly the most endangered large mammal on Earth.\n\nLoss of habitat due to logging and palm oil agriculture, as well as poaching for its horn for use in traditional Asian medicines, have led to the animal's demise.\n\nThe Cincinnati Zoo was the first facility to successfully breed the critically endangered species in captivity. The zoo has been working with Indonesian organizations for 25 years in its efforts to bring the species back from the edge of extinction. (Read \"Rhino Wars\" in National Geographic magazine.)\n\nAfter the death of Suci at age 10, only nine Sumatran rhinos are left in captivity worldwide. Sumatran rhinos in captivity live an average of 35 to 40 years, according to the World Wildlife Fund. (Read about Suci in a 2013 article in National Geographic magazine.)\n\nThe zoo had been treating Suci for hemochromatosis-a genetic disease that causes too much iron to accumulate in the body-for several months, but her condition rapidly deteriorated over the weekend. Suci's mother, Emi, died from the same illness in 2009.\n\n\"Suci was a symbol of hope for her entire species, one that is quickly losing ground in the wild, and her absence will leave a great hole in our hearts,\" said Terri Roth, director of the zoo's Lindner Center for Conservation and Research of Endangered Wildlife.\n\n\"The international community has a great challenge on its hands,\" she said. \"If we don't act quickly, and boldly, the loss of this magnificent animal will be among the great tragedies of our time.\"\n\n\"This Is How Extinction Happens\"\n\nNational Geographic photographer Joel Sartore, who had photographed the 10-year-old animal since she was a baby, called the news \"heartbreaking.\"\n\n\"This is how extinction happens,\" he said. \"The animal is down to so few that each loss is so devastating.\n\n\"The Cincinnati Zoo has done a fantastic job with keeping this species going with little to work with in terms of number of animals,\" said Sartore, who shot the above photo.\n\nSartore featured Suci in his Photo Ark project, which is built around photographing endangered species in zoos. (See more of Sartore's work: \"Stunning Pictures: Ten of the Rarest Animals on Earth.\")\n\nHe said that Suci's death shows that \"you can't protect the animals from everything.\"\n\nThe photographer remembers Suci as a \"charming animal\" that was docile and good-natured.\n\n\"As long as the food held out,\" he said, \"she was there for you.\"",

                "text": "The death on Sunday of the Cincinnati Zoo's 9-year-old female Sumatran rhinoceros, Suci, pushes one of the world's most critically endangered species another step closer to extinction.\n\n\"It just kind of hits you like a semi,\" said Terri Roth, director of the Cincinnati Zoo's Center for Conservation and Research of Endangered Wildlife. The zoo is the world leader in breeding captive Sumatran rhinos thanks to Roth's pioneering research at CREW.\n\nThe cause of the rhino's death has not been determined, but she was being treated for hemochromatosis, also known as iron storage disease. A necropsy was to be performed Monday. The results will not be known for several weeks.\n\nSuci (pronounced SUE-chee) was one of only two Sumatran rhinos in North America. The other is her brother, 6-year-old Harapan, who is in Cincinnati.\n\nThe zoo had been preparing to take the unusual step of breeding the siblings in a last-ditch attempt to save the species, but had not yet done so. The estimated population of such rhinos in the wild is no more than 100. There are now nine in captivity.\n\nSumatran rhinos live in the forests of Malaysia and Indonesia. They are endangered because of habitat loss and poaching; their horns are believed to have medicinal value in some Asian cultures.\n\nIn 2001 in Cincinnati, a Sumatran rhino named Emi gave birth to a male named Andalas. It was the first time in 112 years a Sumatran rhino was bred and born in captivity. Emi and her breeding partner, Ipuh, then produced Suci in 2004 and Harapan in 2007.\n\nIpuh died in February 2013. Emi died in 2009 of hemochromatosis, which led the zoo to suspect Suci might also have the disease; she typically loses weight in the summer and gains it back in the fall and winter. \"This fall, she just didn't come back,\" Roth said. In the last week or so, she took a turn for the worse.\n\nRoth said the zoo will stay involved in the Sumatran rhino program, but it's unclear if breeding will ever happen here again. Regardless, the reproductive techniques pioneered in Cincinnati are being used overseas. In 2007 Andalas was sent to Indonesia's Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary, where he sired a calf in 2012. It is the only place other than Cincinnati to successfully breed the species in captivity.\n\nMalaysian officials had considered sending a male to Cincinnati to breed with Suci, but they were holding out hope that a female could be captured from the wild and bred in Malaysia. In fact, a female was captured recently, Roth said.",

                "text": "When a species approaches extinction, it may be time to take desperate measures\u2014like mating brother with sister.\n\nDo you want to take over?\u201d Paul Reinhart asked, holding out a pail of the sort usually used for mopping floors. Inside was a small buffet\u2019s worth of fruits and vegetables: apple slices, papaya wedges, carrots, bananas. Each of the bananas had been carefully sliced in half but left unpeeled. I picked up one of the halves and held it out. Using his prehensile upper lip, Harapan shoveled it into his mouth. After two or three seconds, he looked up with an expression that, despite our many millions of years of evolutionary separation, clearly communicated to me a desire for more. This time I chose a whole carrot, which he polished off the way a human adolescent might dispatch a pretzel stick.\n\nHarapan, a Sumatran rhinoceros that lives at the Cincinnati Zoo, is 6 years old and not quite fully grown. He\u2019s about eight feet long, with ruddy skin and a coat of coarse, reddish fur. Over the summer he\u2019d put on about 100 pounds, and at the time of my visit, in the fall, he weighed seven-eighths of a ton. After going through the entire contents of the pail, he was evidently still hungry. Reinhart, the zoo\u2019s head rhino keeper, cut open a box of ficus that had been specially flown in from San Diego and held out a branch the size of a small bush. Harapan grabbed it with his lip and chomped away noisily.\n\nHarapan\u2019s name means \u201chope\u201d in Indonesian; depending on how you look at things, this is either entirely apposite or painfully ironic. Harapan was living at the Los Angeles Zoo until this past July, when the decision was made to send him to Cincinnati to be with North America\u2019s only other Sumatran rhino, a 9-year-old named Suci. Suci is female, so the \u201chope\u201d is that when Harapan reaches sexual maturity, something that should happen in the next few months, the pair will produce a calf. The painful part is that Suci is Harapan\u2019s sister.\n\nThe decision to try to breed Harapan and Suci is a sign of just how desperate the situation of Sumatran rhinos has become. Last spring, wildlife experts met in Singapore for what was starkly titled the Sumatran Rhino Crisis Summit. At the summit, it was announced that the number of Sumatran rhinos in the wild had dropped to a perilously low level: only about 100 animals remain. At least that many specialists had traveled to Singapore for the meeting, so most likely there were more people discussing how to save Sumatran rhinos than there were rhinos left to save.\n\nMeanwhile, what\u2019s true of the Sumatran rhino is, to one degree or another, true of all rhino species. The Javan rhino, which once ranged across most of Southeast Asia, is even rarer than the Sumatran, with probably fewer than 50 individuals left, all in a single Javanese reserve. The Indian rhino, the largest of the five living rhino species, which appears to be wearing a wrinkled coat, as in one of Kipling\u2019s \u201cJust So\u201d stories, is down to about 3,000 individuals. A century ago in Africa, the population of black rhinos approached a million; it has since been reduced to around 5,000 animals. (Two years ago, the Western black rhino, a subspecies that lived in and around Cameroon, was officially declared extinct.)\n\nThe white rhino, also from Africa, is the only species not currently classified as threatened. It was hunted nearly to oblivion in the nineteenth century, then made an astonishing comeback in the twentieth, owing to a combination of careful protection and breeding on game farms. Now, in the twenty-first, the white rhino has come under renewed pressure from poachers, who can sell rhino horns on the black market for more than $20,000 a pound. The horn is particularly popular these days in Southeast Asia, where it is sometimes powdered and used as a party \u201cdrug.\u201d (In fact, rhino horn is made of keratin, like your fingernails.)\n\nFollowing the Sumatran Rhino Crisis Summit, officials from the Cincinnati and Los Angeles zoos decided that, given the alarmingly small number of animals left, producing a calf was so important it outweighed concerns about inbreeding. Harapan was coaxed into an extra-large crate and loaded by forklift onto a truck. A police escort accompanied him to LAX, and Reinhart flew with him in a cargo plane to Cincinnati. A few weeks later, the zoo put out a press release announcing Harapan\u2019s arrival. The news that it was going to try to mate siblings seemed to bring the crisis home in a way that the many previous efforts to publicize the rhino\u2019s plight had failed to do. The story was picked up in headlines around the world.\n\n\u201cYou can talk till you\u2019re blue in the face,\u201d Terri Roth, vice president for conservation and science at the zoo, told me. \u201cThere are very few rhinos. The Sumatran rhino is highly endangered. Even when you tell people, There\u2019s only a hundred of them. But when you tell people you have to breed a brother and a sister because that\u2019s all that\u2019s left, boy, does that get their attention. Then people are suddenly like, this is a problem.\u201d\n\nAs it happens, Harapan and Suci are themselves products of an earlier last-ditch effort to save the Sumatran rhino, which was initiated in 1984. That year, a group of conservationists gathered, also in Singapore, to try to hammer out a plan to protect the species. Historically, the Sumatran rhino\u2019s range extended all the way from the foothills of the Himalayas, in what is now Bhutan and northeastern India, down through Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, and the Malay Peninsula and throughout almost all of Sumatra and Borneo. But by the 1980s, it had been reduced to the northern tip of Borneo, some scattered reserves on Sumatra, and a few locations in Peninsular Malaysia, and it was clear that the rhino was in grave danger. Poaching and habitat loss were driving down the number of breeding adults, and those animals that remained were left in isolated forest fragments. It was decided that a captive breeding program should be started to ensure against the species\u2019 total loss. Between 1985 and 1994, 40 animals were captured, seven of which were sent to zoos in the United States.\n\nThe program got off to a rocky start. Ten rhinos were taken into custody in Sabah, a Malaysian state on the northeastern tip of Borneo. Two of them died of injuries sustained during capture. A third died of tetanus, and none produced any offspring. In Peninsular Malaysia, 11 animals were caught. In a span of less than three weeks, five of them died from an outbreak of trypanosomiasis, a parasitic disease spread by flies.\n\nIn the United States, things didn\u2019t go much better. The zoos were feeding the rhinos hay, but Sumatran rhinos, it turns out, can\u2019t live on hay; they require fresh leaves and branches. By the time anyone figured this out, only three of the seven U.S. rhinos were still alive, each in a different city. In 1995 the Bronx and Los Angeles zoos sent their rhinos\u2014both females\u2014to Cincinnati, which had the only surviving male, a bull named Ipuh.\n\nIt was right around this time that Roth arrived in the Queen City from Washington, D.C., where she\u2019d been working with big cats at the National Zoo. It fell to her to try to salvage the captive breeding program. A decade into the effort, the rhino\u2019s reproductive habits still remained mysterious. Sumatran rhinos are shy and solitary. They\u2019re wary of other rhinos and so can\u2019t be kept in the same enclosure. But unless the females and the male were brought together, obviously they couldn\u2019t mate.\n\nRoth has an understated sort of determination. She threw herself into the study of rhino physiology, collecting blood samples, analyzing feces, testing urine. She became adept at performing rhino ultrasounds, an exercise that involved sticking her arm deep into the rhinos\u2019 rectums. The more she learned, the more the challenges seemed to multiply.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated species,\u201d she told me one afternoon in her office, which is decorated with shelves full of wooden, clay, and plush rhinos. Rapunzel, the female from the Bronx Zoo, turned out to be too old to reproduce. Emi, the female from Los Angeles, seemed to be the right age but never seemed to ovulate, a puzzle that took Roth nearly a year to solve. Finally she realized that Sumatran rhinos are what\u2019s known as induced ovulators: they need to be in close proximity to a male before they release an egg. Roth began to arrange carefully monitored \u201cdates\u201d between Emi and Ipuh. Very soon, Emi got pregnant. Then she lost the pregnancy. She conceived again, and the same thing happened. This pattern kept repeating, for a total of five times.\n\nEmi got pregnant again in the spring of 2000. This time, Roth put her on liquid hormone supplements, which the rhino received in the form of progesterone-soaked slices of bread. Finally, the following year, Emi gave birth to Andalas, a male. Three years later, she gave birth to Suci, and three years after that, to Harapan. (Emi died in 2009.) Just before Andalas reached sexual maturity, he was shipped to Sumatra, to a captive breeding facility in Way Kambas National Park, which up to then had failed to produce any pregnancies. In 2012 Andalas fathered Emi\u2019s grandson, a calf named Andatu.\n\nThe three captive-bred rhinos born in Cincinnati and the fourth in Way Kambas clearly don\u2019t make up for the many animals that died along the way. But they are just about the only Sumatran rhinos born anywhere over the past three decades, which is why Harapan has been brought here to mate with his sister.\n\nVery big animals are, of course, very big for a reason. At birth, Harapan weighed 86 pounds. Had he been born on Sumatra, he might have fallen victim to a tiger (though nowadays Sumatran tigers, too, are critically endangered). But probably he would have been protected by his mother, and adult rhinos have no natural predators. The same goes for other so-called megaherbivores; full-grown elephants and hippos are so large no animal dares attack them.\n\nSuch are the advantages of being oversize\u2014what might be called the \u201ctoo big to quail\u201d strategy\u2014that, in evolutionary terms, it would seem to be a pretty good gambit. Indeed, until what might, geologically speaking, be thought of as recent times, the earth was full of Brobdingnagian animals.\n\nToward the end of the last ice age, Europe had aurochs and cave bears and woolly rhinos. (DNA analysis has shown that Sumatran rhinos are the woolly rhino\u2019s closest living relatives.) North America\u2019s behemoths included mastodons, mammoths, and Megalonyx jeffersonii, a ground sloth that weighed nearly a ton. South America had its own gigantic sloths, as well as Toxodon, a genus of mammal with a rhino-like body and a hippo-shaped head, and glyptodonts, relatives of armadillos that in some cases grew to be as large as a Fiat 500. Australia was home to diprotodons, a group of lumbering marsupials colloquially known as rhinoceros wombats; Thylacoleo carnifex, a tiger-size carnivore referred to as a marsupial lion; and the giant short-faced kangaroo. Even smaller islands had their own large beasts. Cyprus had a dwarf elephant and a dwarf hippopotamus. Madagascar was home to three species of pygmy hippos, a family of enormous flightless birds known as elephant birds, and several species of giant lemurs.\n\nWhat happened to all these oversize creatures? Scientists have been debating this question for a century and a half, and they divide into two hostile camps: the climatists and the overkillers. According to the first group, the culprit was the temperature shift that occurred at the end of the last glaciation, 18,000 years ago. According to the second, it was humans who wiped out the megafauna through hunting. One of the earliest climatists was the British geologist Charles Lyell, a mentor to Charles Darwin. Lyell attributed the megafauna\u2019s demise to \u201cthe great modification in climate\u201d caused by the ice age. Darwin agreed with Lyell, though only reluctantly. \u201cI cannot feel quite easy about the glacial period and the extinction of large mammals,\u201d he wrote in a letter to Alfred Russel Wallace, another of the nineteenth century\u2019s great naturalists. Wallace, for his part, initially favored a climatic explanation, but later changed his mind. \u201cLooking at the whole subject again,\u201d he observed in his last book, The World of Life, \u201cI am convinced that\u2026the rapidity of the extinction of so many large Mammalia is actually due to man\u2019s agency.\u201d The whole thing, he said, was really \u201cvery obvious.\u201d\n\nThe debate drags on, but the most recent research has come down decidedly on the side of overkill. A study of Australian megafauna published in 2012, for instance, found that the continent\u2019s giant herbivores died out before any significant climate change had occurred (but, importantly, after humans arrived).\n\nThe megafauna extinction in Australia \u201ccouldn\u2019t have been driven by climate,\u201d Chris Johnson, an ecologist at the University of Tasmania and one of the lead authors of the study, told me on the phone from his office in Hobart. \u201cI think we can say that categorically.\u201d\n\nThe plight of the Sumatran rhino also supports the case for overkill, if only indirectly. As a general rule, the trade-off for being large enough to avoid predation is a low birth rate: megaherbivores take a mega-long time to give rise to a new generation. Rhinos require six or seven years to reach sexual maturity. Gestation then takes about 16 months. For elephants, the process is even more drawn out; they don\u2019t start reproducing until their teens, and their gestation period is nearly two years.\n\nThe problem with people (as far as elephants and rhinos are concerned) is that they don\u2019t obey the usual rules of predator-prey relations. Humans can\u2014and routinely do\u2014kill animals that are much larger and stronger than themselves. This alters the terms of the trade-off and turns what was a highly successful survival strategy into a loser\u2019s game. People don\u2019t have to wantonly slaughter rhinos, just as they didn\u2019t have to wantonly slaughter mammoths or diprotodons, to drive them to extinction. All they have to do is depress the already low reproductive rate, and the population will decline. If the pressure is sustained, ultimately it will drop all the way to zero.\n\nIn the case of the Sumatran rhino, the population has fallen to the point that there are those who argue that all the animals left in the rainforest ought to be pulled out of it.\n\n\u201cIn my strong opinion, the only way to save this species is to bring them into captivity and make them breed,\u201d John Payne, executive director of the Borneo Rhino Alliance and one of the organizers of the Sumatran Rhino Crisis Summit, told me by phone from the city of Kota Kinabalu. \u201cThis is the heart of the matter. That\u2019s controversial. There\u2019s people saying that\u2019s not the way to do it.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the Malaysian government has resolved to bring all of the rhinos left on Borneo into captivity, but at this point there are probably fewer than 10 rhinos remaining there. Sumatra, where the rest of the animals live, is part of Indonesia, and the Indonesian government, by contrast, has endorsed a plan to try to preserve its rhinos in parks. The fact that the rhino\u2019s small population is divided between two antagonistic countries may be another reason to fear for its survival, as the two nations often seem to be working at cross-purposes.\n\nOne day in Cincinnati, I arrived at what is called the rhino\u2019s barn\u2014really a one-story building made of cinder blocks\u2014in time to watch Harapan\u2019s sister, Suci, get breakfast. On an average day, Paul Reinhart told me, Suci goes through about 100 pounds of ficus. (Providing her and Harapan with browse costs the zoo about $200,000 a year.) Once the ficus leaves were gone, Suci started in on the branches. These were an inch or two thick, but she crunched through them easily, and continued on until only a few stray twigs remained.\n\nReinhart described Suci to me as a \u201cgood mix\u201d of her mother, Emi, and her father, Ipuh, who died just a few months before Harapan returned. (E. O. Wilson, who once spent an evening with Emi at the zoo, described the encounter as \u201cone of the most memorable events\u201d of his life.)\n\n\u201cEmi, if there was trouble to get into, she\u2019d get into it,\u201d Reinhart recalled. \u201cSuci, she\u2019s very playful. But she\u2019s also more hardheaded, like her dad.\u201d\n\nSuci is so used to being around people that Reinhart let me hang out with her while he went off to do other chores. I stroked her hairy flanks. Sumatran rhinos have pebbled skin that makes petting them feel a bit like rubbing a tree trunk. Though I can\u2019t say I sensed much playfulness, Suci did seem to me to be affectionate, a little like an overgrown dog. (In fact, rhinos are most closely related to horses.) At the same time, I recalled the warning of one zoo official, who had told me that if Suci suddenly decided to jerk her enormous head, she could easily break my arm. After a while, it was time for the rhino to go get weighed. Some pieces of banana were laid out in front of a pallet scale built into the floor of the next stall over. When Suci trudged over to eat the bananas, the readout from the scale was 1,507 pounds.\n\nThe Cincinnati breeding program demonstrates how seriously humans take extinction. Such is the pain caused by the loss of a single species that people are willing to perform ultrasounds with their arms deep in a rhino\u2019s rectum, if there\u2019s even a chance that this will help. Time and again, people have shown that they care about what Rachel Carson called the \u201cproblem of sharing our earth with other creatures,\u201d and that they\u2019re willing to make sacrifices on those creatures\u2019 behalf.\n\nBut just as clearly, the breeding program shows the limits of such desperate efforts. Once a slow-to-reproduce species like the Sumatran rhino is down to its last 100 individuals, there just aren\u2019t many options left. Terri Roth told me that she was already starting to look for a new project to turn her attention to, because \u201cif there are no other long-term solutions, I don\u2019t want to continue to inbreed.\u201d It is painful to imagine a world in which the Sumatran rhino has no place. But it\u2019s getting increasingly difficult to see what that place is.\n\nLike this article? Donate to NRDC to support OnEarth's groundbreaking nonprofit journalism.",

                "text": "Emi, the Cincinnati Zoo\u2019s world-famous critically endangered Sumatran rhino has done it again! On Sunday evening, April 29, Emi became the first Sumatran rhino in history to produce three calves in captivity, breaking her very own record. Emi delivered a healthy, 86-pound male calf at 10:59 p.m. in her indoor stall. Emi\u2019s legacy has grown as she continues to be the most prolific Sumatran rhino in history.\n\nIt was through years of research that the staff at the Cincinnati Zoo\u2019s Lindner Center for Conservation and Research of Endangered Wildlife (CREW) unraveled the mysteries of Sumatran rhino reproduction. This science has been integrated into the Cincinnati Zoo\u2019s intensive rhino management program that, to-date, remains the only successful Sumatran rhino breeding program in the world.\n\n\"Ten years ago many people were skeptical claiming this species would never breed in a zoo. Yet today, the Cincinnati Zoo is world renowned for being the only place in the world this species is breeding successfully in captivity,\" said Dr. Terri Roth, Vice President of Conservation, Science and Living Collections at the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden. \u201cA third successful birth in just seven years clearly demonstrates how successful a well managed, captive breeding program is for this critically endangered species.\u201d\n\nEmi became restless Sunday evening and her water broke at 9:35 p.m. One hour and 24 minutes later, Emi delivered her calf. Soon after delivery, Emi began licking her calf at 11:06 p.m. and the calf first attempted to stand at 11:28 p.m. The calf successfully nursed at 1:33 a.m. and he continues to nurse every 15-30 minutes. Emi and her calf are doing well and will remain inside for the next two weeks to allow privacy during this bonding time.\n\nIn September of 2001, Emi gave birth to a healthy 72.6-pound calf named, Andalas. This was the first time in 112 years that a Sumatran rhino successfully reproduced in captivity. In February, Andalas made the historical trek back to his ancestry homeland, Sumatra, to take part in a captive breeding program, in an effort to save his species. In 2004, Emi produced a second healthy 75-pound female calf, Suci, who still remains at the Cincinnati Zoo with mom and dad.\n\nGood news like this comes at a critical time in the conservation of Sumatran rhinos. Today less than 300 survive in the wild and only ten Sumatran rhinos exist in captivity worldwide. The Cincinnati Zoo is home to the only four Sumatran rhinos living in the United States. Emi and the Cincinnati Zoo\u2019s male, Ipuh are on loan from the Indonesian government and are the only successful captive breeding pair in the world.\n\nSumatran rhinos are a flagship species for the Cincinnati Zoo\u2019s signature conservation programs. The Sumatran rhinoceros is considered one of the most endangered mammals on earth. In the last 15 years over 50% of the Sumatran rhino population has been lost because of poaching and habitat destruction.",

                "text": "Kabul, Afghanistan - Millions of Afghans have cast their ballots to pick the country's next president, with only isolated attacks on polling stations reported in the country's first democratic transfer of power in its 5,000 year history. After months of manoeuvring, jockeying, tribal meetings and campaigning, Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, Abdullah Abdullah and Zalmai Rassoul have emerged as the frontrunners in Saturday's polls, coming from a field of eight candidates that includes everyone from former mujahedeen commanders to Western-educated technocrats. Al Jazeera's Bernard Smith, reporting from Kabul, described turnout in the polls as high, despite threats of violence and weather disturbance in some parts of the country. Voting has also been extended for at least an hour, with the possibility of another extension depending on the volume of voters, he said. Afghanistan has never had an election so well prepared so well in advance. Nicholas Haysom, deputy head of the UN mission in Afghanistan Four voters were wounded in an explosion at a polling station in the southeastern province of Logar. It was the most serious attack so far on election day that Taliban had vowed to derail, branding it a US-backed sham. Voting was also reportedly disrupted in seven polling stations in Khost province, where two people were reportedly injured, according to Al Jazeera's D. Parvaz, who is reporting from Kabul. Our correspondent also reported that two people, including a police chief were arrested in Wardak province, after they were caught \"stuffing\" five ballot boxes. Elsewhere in Zabul province, three Taliban fighters were reportedly killed after accidentally detonating their explosives. In the province of Faryab, one suicide bomber was arrested, while another explosive was detonated at a polling station in Samangan. As of Saturday afternoon, the election commission has received 200 complaints of poll fraud. And in the northern province of Baghlan, poll workers were beaten and 1,200 ballots headed to two polling stations were tossed in the river. In an interview with Al Jazeera, political analyst Haroun Mir said that Afghan citizens know that the 2014 national and local elections are critical to the country's future, which continues to be threatened by the Taliban. The group has recently carried out several attacks in the capital Kabul and across the country that left many dead and created an atmosphere of insecurity. Even with the deployment of 352,000 troops to provide security for about 12 million voters and 20,752 polling stations, some 748 polling stations remained closed because Afghan security forces could not secure them, according to the IEC. On the eve of the vote, two Associated Press news agency journalists were shot as they reported on the preparations. Anja Niedringhaus, a 48-year-old German photographer, was killed and journalist Kathy Gannon was injured. In a move that underlined the complexities of the race, a last minute drama unfolded on Friday when a rumour swept Kabul that President Hamid Karzai, the incumbent, had switched his support from Rassoul \u2013 who as former foreign minister is seen as Karzai\u2019s chosen successor \u2013 to Ghani. \"That is absolute nonsense. This is very dirty politics, and very false rumours,\" a top official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Al Jazeera. Though the rumour may have been a failed attempt to influence the poll, it was indicative of a fear expressed by some Western diplomats that eleventh hour power politics could influence the poll. Massive fraud during the 2009 campaign undercut Karzai\u2019s legitimacy and allegations are already being made that deals have been cut to stuff ballot boxes. Some observers, though, expect this election to be fairer and better-run. \"Afghanistan has never had an election so well prepared so well in advance,\" Nicholas Haysom, deputy head of the UN mission in Afghanistan, told Al Jazeera. \"Really everything has been delivered according to timeline both in regard to broad legislative and other provisions but also the delivery of ballot papers, sensitive and non-sensitive materials to the seven thousand-odd voting centres.\" With analysts predicting that a vote of over 50 percent, required for an outright win, is unlikely to be achieved by any of the leading candidates, a May 28th second round between the two who poll the highest is a real prospect. The US and other nations are watching closely and hoping the $126 mln foreign-funded poll goes smoothly. A free and fair election would give them a small success to point to after 13 years of bloodshed since US-led forces toppled the Taliban, and make the scheduled pull-out of most foreign troops this year easier.",

Election officials hold a ballot paper during the vote counting process at a polling station in Herat Province, April 5, 2014.\n\nIt will take six weeks for results to come in from across Afghanistan's rugged terrain and a final result to be declared in the race to succeed President Hamid Karzai.\n\nThis could be the beginning of a potentially dangerous period for Afghanistan at a time when the war-ravaged country desperately needs a leader to stem rising violence as foreign troops prepare to leave.\n\n\"Today we proved to the world that this is a people driven country,\" Karzai, wearing his trademark green robe and a lambskin hat, told his nation in televised remarks.\n\n\"On behalf of the people, I thank the security forces, election commission and people who exercised democracy and ... turned another page in the glorious history of Afghanistan.\"\n\nOne of the eight candidates will have to score over 50 percent of the vote to avoid a run-off with his nearest rival.\n\nThe Taliban threat to wreck the vote through bombings and assassination failed to materialise, and violent incidents were on a far smaller scale than feared.\n\nTurnout was seven million out of 12 million eligible voters, or about 58 percent, according to preliminary estimates, election commission chief Ahmad Yousuf Nuristani told reporters.\n\nThat was well above the 4.5 million who voted at the last election in 2009 which was marred by widespread fraud.\n\n\"I am here to vote and I am not afraid of any attacks,\" said Haji Ramazan as he stood in line at a polling station in rain-drenched Kabul. \"This is my right, and no one can stop me.\"\n\nIn Washington, President Barack Obama congratulated the Afghan people on the elections.\n\n\"We commend the Afghan people, security forces, and elections officials on the turnout for today's vote - which is in keeping with the spirited and positive debate among candidates and their supporters in the run-up to the election,\" Obama said in a statement.\n\n\"These elections are critical to securing Afghanistan's democratic future, as well as continued international support, and we look to the Afghan electoral bodies to carry out their duties in the coming weeks to adjudicate the results - knowing that the most critical voices on the outcome are those of Afghans themselves,\" Obama said.\n\nThe United States could point to the advance of democracy in one of the world's most violent countries as a success as it prepares to withdraw the bulk of its troops this year.\n\nIt has spent $90 billion on aid and security training since helping Afghan forces to topple a strict Islamist Taliban regime in 2001, but U.S. support for Afghanistan's fight against the Taliban has faded.\n\nAs U.S. troops get ready to go home, the Taliban threat and uncertainty over neighbour Pakistan's intentions leave the worry that Afghanistan could enter a fresh cycle of violence, and once again become a haven for groups like al Qaeda.\n\nThe United States has been at odds with Karzai who has refused U.S. entreaties to sign a bilateral security agreement that would permit about 8,000 U.S. troops to remain in the country after the formal U.S. withdrawal at the end of the year.\n\nU.S. officials are keeping open the option of leaving behind a troop contingent for training Afghan forces and for a counter-terrorism mission if an agreement can be signed later this year by Karzai's successor.\n\n\"The United States remains ready to work with the next president of Afghanistan. We will continue to stand with the people of Afghanistan as they work to build a democratic future,\" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement.\n\nDuring Saturday's election, there were dozens of reports of minor roadside bombs, attacks on polling stations, police and voters. In the eastern province of Kunar alone, two voters died and 14 were wounded, while 14 Taliban militants were killed.\n\nInterior Minister Umer Daudzai said nine policemen, seven soldiers, 89 Taliban fighters were killed in the past 24 hours across the country, adding that four civilians were also killed.\n\nDozens died in a spate of attacks in the preceding weeks. A veteran Associated Press photographer was killed and a senior correspondent of the same news agency was wounded on Friday when a policeman opened fire on the two women in the east as they reported on preparations for the poll.\n\nMost people had expected the election to be better run than the chaotic 2009 vote that handed Karzai a second term.\n\nThe constitution barred Karzai from seeking another term. But, after 12 years in power, he is widely expected to retain influence through politicians loyal to him.\n\nFormer foreign ministers Abdullah Abdullah and Zalmay Rassoul, and former finance minister Ashraf Ghani were regarded as the favourites to succeed Karzai.\n\nMore than 350,000 Afghan troops were deployed, guarding against attacks on polling stations and voters. The capital, Kabul, was sealed off by rings of roadblocks and checkpoints.\n\nIn the city of Kandahar, cradle of the Taliban insurgency, the mood was tense. Vehicles were not allowed to move on the roads and checkpoints were set up at every intersection.\n\nHamida, a 20-year-old teacher working at a Kandahar polling station, said more than a dozen women turned up in the first two hours of voting and added that she expected more to come despite the threat of an attack by the Taliban.\n\n\"We are trying not to think about it,\" she said, only her honey-brown eyes visible through her black niqab.\n\nRaising questions about the legitimacy of the vote even before it began, the election commission announced that at least 10 percent of polling stations were expected to be shut due to security threats, and most foreign observers left Afghanistan in the wake of a deadly attack on a hotel in Kabul last month.\n\nIn some areas of the country voters complained that polling stations had run out of ballot papers. The interior ministry said six officials - including an intelligence agent - were detained for trying to rig the vote, and elsewhere several people were arrested for trying to use fake voter cards.\n\nIf there is no outright winner, the two frontrunners would go into a run-off on May 28, spinning out the process into the holy month of Ramadan when life slows to a crawl.\n\nA long delay would leave little time to complete a pact between Kabul and Washington to keep up to 10,000 U.S. troops in the country beyond 2014.\n\nKarzai has rejected the pact, but the three frontrunners have pledged to sign it. Without the pact, far weaker Afghan forces would be left on their own to fight the Taliban.\n\nThe election is a landmark after 13 years of struggle that has killed at least 16,000 Afghan civilians and thousands more soldiers. Nearly 3,500 members of the U.S.-led coalition force have died since deployment in the country over a decade ago.\n\nKarzai's relations with the United States became increasingly strained as Afghan casualties mounted. He also voiced frustration with Washington over a lack of pressure on Pakistan to do more to stop the Taliban based in the borderlands.\n\nAlthough his departure marks a turning point, none of his would-be successors would bring radical change, diplomats say.\n\n\"Whether the election will be the great transformative event that everybody expects is, I think, delusional.\" Sarah Chayes, a South Asia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace told a media briefing on the eve of the vote.",

Her colleague, Kathy Gannon, is reported to be stable.\n\nThe attack took place in the town of Khost near the border with Pakistan.\n\nIt comes as Afghanistan intensifies security ahead of presidential elections on Saturday, in response to threats of violence by the Taliban.\n\nThe new president will succeed Hamid Karzai, who has been in power since the 2001 fall of the Taliban but is constitutionally barred from seeking a third consecutive term.\n\nThe BBC's Lyse Doucet in Kabul says the run-up to this historic poll has already been the bloodiest, and fears of electoral fraud are pronounced.\n\nThe two journalists had been travelling with a convoy of election workers - protected by Afghan security forces - delivering ballots from the centre of Khost to the district of Tani, on the outskirts.\n\nThey were in their own car with an interpreter and an AP freelancer, AP says.\n\nThe freelancer said they had arrived in a heavily guarded compound shortly before the shooting.\n\nAs they were waiting in the back seat of the car for the convoy to move, a unit commander shouted \"Allahu Akbar\" (God is Great) and opened fire on them, the freelancer told AP.\n\nHe then surrendered to the other police and was arrested, the agency adds.\n\nAnja Niedringhaus, 48, a German photojournalist who was part of a team that won the Pulitzer Prize for their coverage of the war in Iraq, was killed instantly.\n\nCanadian-born Kathy Gannon, 60, who had been the AP's bureau chief in Afghanistan for many years and is currently a special correspondent for the region, was shot twice.\n\nShe underwent surgery and is said to be in a stable condition.\n\n\"Anja and Kathy together have spent years in Afghanistan covering the conflict and the people there,\" said AP executive editor Kathleen Carroll.\n\n\"Anja was a vibrant, dynamic journalist well-loved for her insightful photographs, her warm heart and joy for life. We are heartbroken at her loss.\"\n\nPresident Karzai expressed his sadness at the incident and pledged to carry out a full investigation.\n\nThe interior ministry said the officer who shot the women had commanded a police unit, which had been under 48 hours of mortar attack from insurgents across the border in Pakistan.\n\nHe may have mistakenly thought the car was carrying insurgents as the police were unaware that the journalists were travelling in the area, interior ministry spokesman Sidiq Siddiqi said.\n\nThe district lies on the border with Pakistan's Waziristan region, with the Pakistan-based Haqqani network strong and influential in the area.\n\nViolence has increased across Afghanistan in recent weeks, ahead of the election, and foreign reporters have been among the victims.\n\nThe BBC's Afghanistan correspondent, David Loyn, says the election is being protected by the biggest military operation since the fall of the Taliban - with the deployment of nearly 200,000 troops.\n\nRings of security have been set up around each polling centre, with the police at the centre and hundreds of troops on the outside.\n\nThere are eight candidates for president, including former foreign ministers Abdullah Abdullah and Zalmai Rassoul, and former finance minister Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai.\n\nIf nobody wins more than 50% of the vote, a run-off election will be necessary.\n\nA new president may give the US a chance to repair relations with Kabul, which dropped to an all-time low with Hamid Karzai late last year when he refused to sign a bilateral security agreement that would allow up to 10,000 troops to stay in Afghanistan when Nato combat missions end this year.",

Throughout the 1980s he co-ordinated treatment and healthcare for resistance fighters and civilians, and that is where he first became associated with Masoud.\n\nServing as foreign minister in the short-lived government headed by the Northern Alliance, Dr Abdullah continued as \"foreign minister in exile\" throughout the years of rule by the Taliban, which was ousted in 2001.\n\nFollowing the fall of the Taliban he was foreign minister but resigned in 2006 and registered as an independent candidate to contest 2009's election.\n\nThe suave and smooth-talking politician during that election campaign said then: \"Karzai turned a golden opportunity into disaster. There's no point giving him five more years.\"\n\nHe's hoping the Afghan electorate give him the benefit of the doubt this time round.\n\nA former World Bank academic, who carved out a respected international career during decades in exile, Ashraf Ghani has a PhD in anthropology from Columbia University in the US.\n\nHe won 31.5% of votes in the first round.\n\nWidely seen as a technocrat and an academic, he served as a special adviser to the UN's envoy to Afghanistan from 2001.\n\nHe was appointed economic adviser in Hamid Karzai's interim government immediately after the Taliban's fall and had the crucial brief of reconstruction and foreign aid.\n\nBut in 2004 he declined to join Mr Karzai's new government, asking instead to be appointed as chancellor of Kabul University. Most recently he has had responsibility for Afghanistan's security transition.\n\nHe also made a bid for power in the 2009 presidential elections - giving up his US citizenship in order to do so - but ended up only polling about 3% of the vote.\n\nHis campaign then made poverty alleviation among the rural poor one of its key concerns.\n\n\"They know my voice,\" Mr Ghani said of Afghan voters. \"The only person who has addressed the issues of rural Afghanistan has been me. You put me in front of any rural village in Afghanistan and see who connects to who.\"",

                "text": "British-led Task Force Helmand closed yesterday after eight years of frontline military operations involving tens of thousands of UK servicemen and women.\n\nIts functions will now be absorbed into the wider US-led Regional Command (South West) in the latest step towards the withdrawal of UK troops from the country, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said.\n\nThe milestone marks the end of the 16th Task Force Helmand operation for the British-led coalition task force, which also included soldiers from the US, Denmark and Estonia, and at its height had 137 bases across central Helmand Province.\n\nThe move is the end of the UK-led combat mission in Afghanistan, but British forces will continue to support their Afghan counterparts in Helmand - providing training, advice and assistance until the end of UK combat operations later this year.\n\nIt comes after Task Force Helmand moved from provincial capital Lashkar Gah, where it had been based since 2006, to Camp Bastion in August.\n\nIts disbandment yesterday is the latest in a series of steps marking Britain's withdrawal of combat troops from Afghanistan - due to be complete by the end of this year.\n\nLast month the MoD announced the closure or handover of three frontline bases in Helmand, leaving just one outside Camp Bastion.\n\nSome 448 British forces personnel or MoD civilians have died in Afghanistan since the start of operations in October 2001.\n\nThe latest was Sapper Adam Moralee from 32 Engineer Regiment, who died on March 5 in Camp Bastion when he was injured while preparing equipment to be brought back to the UK.\n\nDefence Secretary Philip Hammond said: \"At this important point in the final year of the UK's lengthy and crucially important combat mission, it is only right to reflect on the significant achievements - and sacrifices - of the past eight years.\n\n\"The servicemen and women who have fought under the command of Task Force Helmand have protected the security of the UK and its people; prevented international terrorists from using Afghanistan as a base; and created the conditions for a brighter, more secure and more stable future for the country.\n\n\"However, the job is not over yet and UK troops will continue to operate in often risky and challenging conditions in Helmand supporting the Afghan forces and continuing the redeployment effort, until UK combat operations are concluded later this year.\"\n\nDespite the closure of Task Force Helmand, UK troops will continue their mission in central Helmand province until the International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) mission draws to a close at the end of the year.\n\nThe number of British personnel in the province has reduced from a peak of more than 10,000 to around half that number as Afghan National Security Forces have taken the lead in security across Afghanistan.\n\nBritish troops will remain in Camp Bastion this year, either working in the coalition force under 5,000-strong predominantly-US Regional Command (South West) , which will support Afghan National Security Forces during this month's presidential elections, or supporting the redeployment of equipment back to the UK.\n\nAt a ceremony to mark the end of Task Force Helmand, its final commander Brigadier James Woodham, said: \"This is a significant moment in the drawdown of British forces in Afghanistan.\n\n\"It has been an honour to serve as the last commander of Task Force Helmand and command the soldiers of 7th Armoured Brigade, the Desert Rats, on operations.\n\n\"The task force has achieved so much since 2006 and I pay homage to all of those who have served under the task force.\n\n\"We are leaving Helmand in a better place and the Afghan National Security Forces are well set to continue to deliver security to the region.\"\n\nDeputy commander Regional Command (South West), Brigadier Robert Thomson, who will be its senior British officer, added: \"Having served in the province back in 2009, I have witnessed the progress delivered here by British forces under Task Force Helmand.\n\n\"In Regional Command (South West) we will continue that great work, supporting the Afghan National Security Forces and the people of Helmand, until the end of 2014 to see out the mission here alongside our US comrades.\"\n\nSo far more than 1,578 vehicles and items of major equipment have been redeployed from the front line and are being made ready for future operations\n\nThe MoD has also announced that a contract worth up to \u00a320 million has been awarded to Coventry-based Morgan Advanced Materials, for maintenance and servicing of its Cougar fleet of armoured vehicles, which includes Wolfhound and Mastiff vehicles, as they return from Afghanistan.",

                "text": "Pressure on the culture secretary, Maria Miller, has been ramped up by a poll suggesting a large majority of voters think she should be dropped from the cabinet, stripped of her responsibility for press regulation and thrown out of the House of Commons over her expenses.\n\nA Survation poll for the Mail on Sunday found that almost three-quarters of voters (73%) thought her 32-second apology to the House of Commons on Thursday was inadequate, and similar numbers (75%) felt David Cameron was wrong to offer her his support.\n\nSome 78% of those questioned said she should forfeit her cabinet post as culture secretary, 66% said she should lose powers over press regulation and 68% said she should be \"sacked\" as an MP \u2013 something that is not currently possible, as the government has yet to introduce the power of recall promised in the 2010 coalition agreement.\n\nMeanwhile, the Sunday Telegraph quoted an unnamed \"senior minister\", speaking on condition of anonymity, as saying: \"In my view she has clearly behaved in a way that is incompatible with what she should be doing as a cabinet minister. The decision to keep her on undermines the prime minister because he has talked about a new kind of politics.\"\n\nMiller's apology came after a cross-party panel of MPs overruled parliament's standards commissioner, Kathryn Hudson, who recommended after an inquiry that the culture secretary should repay \u00a345,000 in expenses for a house she shared with her parents.\n\nThe Commons standards committee instead decided she needed to hand back just \u00a35,800 and say sorry for failing to co-operate fully with the inquiry.\n\nThe watchdog in charge of MPs' expenses said it was time for the House of Commons to give up the power to police itself over standards and ethics, warning: \"MPs marking their own homework always ends in scandal.\"\n\nSir Ian Kennedy, chairman of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), told the Sunday Times: \"We have made great progress in cleaning up the problems of the past. To avoid further damage to parliament in the future, it should have the confidence to give away powers in regulating itself and see that independent regulation is the best, most transparent way forward.\n\n\"MPs marking their own homework always ends in scandal. It happened with expenses. It will happen with standards investigations too. Ipsa has shown that independent regulation of parliamentary behaviour can work. Our reforms have cleaned up the system.\"\n\nKennedy said MPs should \"learn a lesson\" from the independent system of regulation of expenses introduced in the wake of the 2009 scandal and ensure that Hudson too is \"given the freedom to carry out her work and not have her wings clipped by MPs\".\n\nLetters released following Miller's apology revealed that she told Hudson it would be \"irrational, perverse and unreasonable\" to uphold the complaint against her and warned that she could go over her head to ask the MPs on the standards committee to intervene.\n\nIn another message, she wrote: \"In light of the evidence that is before you \u2026 to continue to regard this spurious complaint as a serious matter would give it credence it does not deserve and undermine the inquiry process in comparison to issues that really are serious matters.\"\n\nJohn Mann, the Labour MP whose complaint sparked the commissioner's investigation, said: \"These emails show that Maria Miller bullied and threatened the independent commissioner.\"\n\nBut Grant Shapps said he believed Miller had just been frustrated at the long-drawn-out inquiry. The Tory chairman told Channel 4 News: \"I don't want to get into the semantics of which words should have been used. The simple fact of the matter is that Maria has accepted in her statement to parliament that this perhaps could have all been handled much faster.\n\n\"I'm sure she was frustrated that it hadn't been and that's why she said she of course unreservedly apologised. This has been now very thoroughly investigated in a huge amount of detail, every aspect of it. It's come to a conclusion \u2026 It's happened now, she's made an apology and the prime minister has said it draws a line under it, and that's of course what it does.\"\n\nHe also defended the culture secretary's special adviser Jo Hindley, who was caught on tape telling a reporter investigating the expenses story that she wanted to \"flag up\" the fact that Miller would be meeting her editor to discuss the Leveson inquiry into press ethics.\n\nDespite the claim of the then Telegraph editor, Tony Gallagher, that this amounted to a threat, Shapps insisted that Leveson had been mentioned only in the context of the doorstepping of Miller's elderly father, who was ill at the time.\n\nCameron has twice publicly voiced his support for the culture secretary, but on Saturday omitted her from a list of several cabinet ministers whom he singled out for praise in a speech to the Conservative spring forum.\n\nThe deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, declined to come to Cameron's aid, saying: \"All the issues to do with her position and indeed to do with the behaviour of her office, alleged or not, is entirely a matter for the prime minister.\"\n\nThere was further embarrassment for Miller when a string of mocking messages was sent out on the Twitter feed of her own Department for Culture, Media and Sport.\n\nThe first bogus tweet from the @DCMS account said: \"Seriously though guys which one of us hasn't embezzled and cheated the taxpayer?? #FreeMariaMiller.\"\n\nIt was swiftly followed by \"@Maria_MillerMP is like a modern day Robin Hood, she robs the poor to help the rich\" and then \"Is @Maria_MillerMP guilty? We will let the public decide\".\n\nA spokeswoman from the DCMS confirmed that the account had been hacked and said they had \"absolutely no idea\" who was responsible.",

But Duncan Smith offered strong personal support for the culture secretary as he came close to suggesting that she has been the victim of a witch-hunt.\n\nSpeaking on the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1, he said Miller was a victim of \"media antipathy\" in light of her role introducing the Leveson proposals. Many Tories were also angry with her after she introduced gay marriage, he added.\n\nThe work and pensions secretary raised the prospect of a major overhaul of the way MPs regulate their affairs as Miller faced a third consecutive day of damaging headlines about her expenses.\n\nThe culture secretary was forced by the Commons standards committee to repay \u00a35,800 in overclaimed expenses in mortgage payments related to her \"second\" home in Wimbledon. She was also asked to apologise for her conduct towards Kathryn Hudson, the parliament standards commissioner, after documents showed that she accused the watchdog of acting outside the law.\n\nDuncan Smith, who worked closely with Miller in her previous ministerial post as minister for the disabled, offered strong personal support for the culture secretary. He said: \"I am enormously fond of her. She has done a very good job in a very difficult set of circumstances with the Leveson inquiry that has stirred up a lot of media antipathy to her.\n\n\"And also the gay marriage stuff \u2013 there are a lot of Conservatives out there who, perhaps, were not necessarily in support of it all and so feel rather bitter about that. I have known her to be a reasonable and honest person.\"\n\nDuncan Smith said the prime minister would have to consider the row over Miller's expenses. But he said: \"I am supportive of Maria because if we are not careful we end up with a witch-hunt of somebody. The committee has told her to repay some money and she should apologise and she has done both those.\"\n\nIn a sign that the government acknowledges the damage from another row over expenses, Duncan Smith said he was open to a proposal by Sir Ian Kennedy, the chairman of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), to end the right of MPs to sit in judgment on their peers.\n\nJohn Mann, the Labour MP who lodged the original complaint about Miller, has been highly critical after the standards committee, which includes 10 MPs and three non-voting lay members, recommended that Miller should repay \u00a35,800 in expenses. This was considerably lower than the \u00a345,000 proposed by Hudson.\n\nDuncan Smith said it may be right to end the way in which MPs have the sole right \u2013 apart from the non-voting lay members of the standards committee \u2013 to sit in judgment on the findings by the independent standards watchdog.\n\nHe said of the proposals by the Ipsa head: \"I am very happy for that to be debated. I am amongst a number of those who feel this goes on and on and on eating away at the credibility of parliament. Whatever it takes to restore that credibility \u2013 I am very open to independent people looking at this. Personally I think the sooner we can get rid of this nonsense the better.\"\n\nA poll by Survation for the Mail on Sunday found overwhelming opposition to Miller. The poll found that 78% thought Miller should lose her cabinet post. It found that 82% of Tories thought she should go.\n\nAn unnamed minister told the Sunday Telegraph that Miller should lose her cabinet post because her conduct was \"incompatible\" with her role as a cabinet minister.\n\nKennedy, the Ipsa head, said Miller's conduct showed the need to end the right of MPs to regulate their own affairs. Ipsa was established after the expenses scandal in 2009 when MPs handed the running of expenses to an independent body. Wrongdoing is investigated by the standards commissioner but the standards committee makes the final judgment on any findings.\n\nKennedy told the Sunday Times: \"We have made great progress in cleaning up the problems of the past. To avoid further damage to parliament in the future, it should have the confidence to give away powers in regulating itself and see that independent regulation is the best, most transparent way forward.\"",

There is also the important question of whether there has been a breach of the code of conduct for special advisers or the ministerial code,\" she said.\n\nBut Ms Coffey, who sat on the Culture, Media and Sport Committee between 2010 and 2012, told BBC Two's Newsnight that she had heard the recording and believed the special adviser had been trying to protect Mrs Miller's elderly parents from press intrusion.\n\nShe said: \"I heard an adviser to the culture secretary suggesting that it's inappropriate to be doorstepping elderly parents of somebody who has just come out of hospital.\"\n\nDavid Cameron's official spokesman, Craig Oliver, has also denied claims he had \"threatened\" the former editor of the Telegraph over the Leveson Inquiry in relation to the story.\n\nThe paper reported in December 2012 that Mrs Miller had claimed \u00a390,000 in expenses towards the mortgage on the south London property where her parents lived, while designating her main home as a rented property in her constituency of Basingstoke.\n\nFreedom of information campaigner Heather Brooke said the Telegraph reporter who had visited the house had been carrying out \"a public interest piece of reporting\".\n\nMs Brooke said that the journalist had no choice but to visit the property to establish the facts of who was living there and that it was \"disingenuous to use this argument of privacy\".\n\nEmails released by the standards committee showed how Mrs Miller tried to persuade Ms Hudson that her investigation into her expenses was \"unreasonable\" and suggested she may go over the watchdog's head to ask MPs to intervene.\n\nIn one email, Mrs Miller said: \"It may be that I shall need to refer this to the supervisory jurisdiction of the standards committee but I hope this can be avoided.\"\n\nIn another, she said: \"As should by now be obvious, a decision to uphold the complaint would be irrational, perverse and ... unreasonable - that is to say would be a decision that no reasonable decision maker could properly reach.\"\n\nAnother said: \"In light of the evidence that is before you ... to continue to regard this spurious complaint as a serious matter would give it credence it does not deserve and undermine the inquiry process in comparison to issues that really are serious matters.\"\n\nThe BBC's political reporter Alan Soady said the camps in the row were developing, with some people suspecting there had been \"some bullying going on\" in reaction to scrutiny of Mrs Miller's expenses.\n\nBut our correspondent also said plenty of Conservative MPs and others wondered if the ongoing row was the result of newspapers with a \"vendetta\" getting their own back for Mrs Miller's role in press regulation after the Leveson Inquiry into press conduct.\n\nShe currently has Prime Minister David Cameron's backing - on Friday he told reporters to \"leave it there\" with questions on Ms Miller, who has accepted committee findings into her expenses claims and apologised.\n\nBut with various strands of the story ongoing, her position could depend on how long it lasted, our reporter added.\n\nFormer chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, Sir Alistair Graham, told the BBC that Mrs Miller's failure to co-operate fully with the commissioner's inquiry was \"shocking\".\n\nHe suggested it would also be shocking to the public that the standards committee had reduced the amount Mrs Miller must repay.",

                "text": "Support for culture secretary Maria Miller appeared to be ebbing as Tory MPs said David Cameron should sack or demote her in an expected summer reshuffle over her handling of an expenses dispute.\n\nSenior members of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers, who have the ear of the prime minister, said they expected Miller to be removed from her post to end a barrage of criticism from Conservative-supporting newspapers in the runup to next year's general election. One MP high in the hierarchy said of Miller, who made a curt 30-second apology to the House of Commons after she was ordered to pay back \u00a35,800 in overclaimed allowances \"I think it was very unwise to give the short, perfunctory apology she did. I suspect she may be sacked, demoted or moved in June.\"\n\nAn unnamed senior minister said on Saturday night that Miller should resign, while a poll for one Sunday newspaper suggested more than three-quarters of voters wanted her sacked. Another member of the 1922 committee executive said he shared the view that Miller would have to resign.\n\nSir Ian Kennedy, chairman of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, weighed in, saying MPs can no longer be trusted on expenses. He told the Sunday Times: \"MPs marking their own homework always ends in scandal. It happened with expenses. It will happen with standards investigations too. Ipsa has shown that independent regulation of parliamentary behaviour can work. Our reforms have cleaned up the system.\"\n\nCameron is expected to reshuffle his cabinet soon after May's European parliament elections, putting in place the team that will take the party into the general election. On Saturday fellow cabinet ministers, including party chairman Grant Shapps, tried to bolster Miller's position, saying the MP for Basingstoke had been cleared on the substantive charges, had apologised for errors, and that it was time to \"draw a line\" under the matter.\n\nBut as deputy prime minister Nick Clegg failed to offer strong backing \u2013 he said Miller's future was a matter for the prime minister \u2013 and Labour raised questions over allegations that No 10 and one of Miller's aides had tried to intimidate journalists planning to write about her expenses, her future looked increasingly doubtful.\n\nOn Thursday, the commissioner for parliamentary standards, Kathryn Hudson, recommended that Miller repay \u00a345,000 in expenses for a house she shared with her parents and had wrongly claimed was her \"second home\". The rules say second homes must be used exclusively for parliamentary purposes that would not include using them to accommodate parents. The cross-party House of Commons standards committee, which adjudicated on the report, overruled the watchdog and decided she only needed to hand back \u00a35,800 in overclaimed mortgage interest. Miller was ordered to apologise to the Commons for failing to co-operate fully with the inquiries, which she did in a statement whose brevity shocked MPs.\n\nThe controversy deepened after the Daily Telegraph released an audio tape of a 2012 phone call between one of Miller's adviser's, Jo Hindley, and a Telegraph reporter, in which Hindley drew attention to her boss's role in policy on press standards \u2013 a move seen by the paper's then editor, Tony Gallagher, as a threat. No 10 and Hindley strongly deny they threatened the newspaper.\n\nEvidence of strong-arm tactics has also come to light in emails released by the standards committee, which showed how Miller tried to persuade Hudson that the investigation into her expenses was not a reasonable one. In one, she wrote: \"As should by now be obvious, a decision to uphold the complaint would be irrational, perverse and \u2026 unreasonable \u2013 that is to say it would be a decision that no reasonable decision-maker could properly reach.\"\n\nAsked on Radio 4's Any Questions whether she should quit, Tory MP Jesse Norman failed to offer a ringing endorsement. He said: \"I think that is a matter for her and the prime minister.\"\n\nConservative backbenchers, while sympathetic with Miller over details of her expenses, were shocked by her failure to show real contrition in the Commons and fear the dispute will continue with newspapers opposed to apparent government attempts to give politicians a role in press regulation.\n\nThe former chairman of the committee on standards in public life, Sir Alistair Graham, said he was shocked at Miller's behaviour. \"The degree of lack of co-operation and the attempt to divert the commissioner from addressing the issues concerned both seem fairly exceptional.\n\n\"I think particularly for a senior cabinet minister, who you expect to show a leadership role in co-operating with whatever expenses system is around, it is pretty shocking.\n\n\"I think the public will be very shocked that the committee did overturn one of the key recommendations about how much should be repaid back, when there is a real possibility that the minister made a capital gain with the help of public funds.\"\n\nKennedy, the Ipsa chairman, said: \"We have made great progress in cleaning up the problems of the past. To avoid further damage to parliament in the future, it should have the confidence to give away powers in regulating itself and see that independent regulation is the best, most transparent way forward.\n\nMPs should \"learn a lesson\" from the independent system of regulation of expenses that was introduced in the way of the 2009 scandal and ensure that Ms Hudson too is \"given the freedom to carry out her work and not have her wings clipped by MPs\", said Sir Ian.\n\nLabour stopped short of calling for Miller to resign but said many questions remained unanswered. It is demanding to know more about allegations she and No 10 tried to push the Daily Telegraph off the story by reminding journalists of her responsibility for policy on the press. Shadow Commons leader Angela Eagle said: \"The latest revelations and the release of a recording raise further serious questions for Maria Miller and David Cameron. They urgently need to make clear what they knew about these calls and what action they took about them.\n\n\"There is also the important question of whether there has been a breach of the code of conduct for special advisers or the ministerial code. It is time for David Cameron to show some leadership, stand up and say that what has happened was wrong and to answer these questions in full.\"\n\nLabour MP John Mann, who raised the first complaint over Miller's expenses with the commissioner and who has said she should be sacked, said he was now looking at whether she owed tax on expenses that had been overpaid. He added that it was \"very disturbing\" that the Commons standards committee had overlooked evidence that she tried to intimidate the commissioner.",

This was overruled by cross-party House of Commons Standards Committee who calculated that Mrs Miller should pay \u00a35,800 in over-claimed mortgage interest.\n\nThe 10-member committee attempted to defuse criticism of its actions by releasing a joint statement with Ms Hudson describing the situation as \"complex\" and stressing Mrs Miller had been rebuked for failing to co-operate with the investigation.\n\nIn the released audio tape Ms Hindley is heard telling the reporter that another journalist who called at Mrs Miller's home had spoken to the MP's father, who had recently been in hospital. Some details were omitted from the recording to protect his privacy.\n\n\"I should just flag up as well, whilst you're on it, that when she doorstepped him, she got Maria's father, who's just had a [omitted] and come out of [omitted],\" Ms Hindley says.\n\n\"Maria has obviously been having quite a lot of editors' meetings around Leveson at the moment. So I'm just going to flag up that connection for you to think about,\u201d she adds.\n\nMr Gallagher told BBC2's Newsnight that he regarded the reference to the inquiry a threat: \"Bear in mind this was a time of what I would call anti-press hysteria.\n\n\"The press was feeling very vulnerable just after the publication of the Leveson Report and there was a great desire on the part of all media organisations not to fall foul of somebody raising the spectre of Leveson.\n\n\"We were in no doubt that threats were being made. Joanna Hindley was not even attempting to be sophisitcated about it - she menaced the reporter openly... The reporter took that as a very clear threat.\"\n\nA Whitehall source said that it was clear from the recording, made without Ms Hindley's knowledge, that she had been voicing concerns about the doorstepping of Mrs Miller's father, who was ill, and had been making clear that the minister would raise the issue at an upcoming meeting with the editor, which happened to relate to the Leveson report.\n\nThe source said that Mrs Miller did in fact speak to Mr Gallagher about the treatment of her father, and received a written apology from him.\n\nMr Gallagher claimed that he later received a similar call from Downing Street director of communications Craig Oliver, adding: \"When you get the Prime Minister's spokesman making a similar phone call to you a couple of days later, you add all three calls up and you can only conclude that they are trying to harass you and stop you from publishing the story.\"\n\nBut Mr Oliver told the BBC: \"It is utterly false to suggest that I threatened Tony Gallagher over Leveson in any way. The conversation I had with him was about the inappropriate doorstepping of an old man.\"\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron has offered his \u201cwarm support\u201d to the Secretary, despite a 32-second apology she made to the Commons earlier in the week being ill-regarded by other MPs.",

                "text": "What does the public seek from its politicians? Transparency, honesty, integrity. David Cameron understood that when, in 2009, he insisted that people at the top of government have to be \u201cwhiter than white\u201d. He spoke in reference to the expenses scandal \u2013 broken by The Telegraph \u2013 that revealed the extent to which MPs were abusing the system and, in some cases, defrauding the taxpayer. Promising a new regime if he was elected prime minister, the Tory leader said, \u201cThis sort of stuff is not going to go on into the next parliament.\u201d\n\nContrast that admirably tough attitude with his response to the Maria Miller scandal. He appeared confused by the process involved in the investigation of his Culture Secretary\u2019s mortgage claims and even tried to close the debate down. \u201cShe has apologised,\u201d he concluded. \u201cI think that we should leave it there.\u201d\n\nBut that is not good enough: the case against Mrs Miller is growing. It is charged that she designated what looked an awful lot like her first home as her second home, claimed taxpayer support for its upkeep, and made an enormous profit on its sale. The Parliamentary Standards Commissioner concluded she had over-claimed, and we now know that Mrs Miller sent a staggering quantity of emails to the commissioner in an attempt to make her drop these accusations.\n\nMeanwhile, a ruling by MPs on the standards committee found her actions \u201creasonable in the light of the guidance available at the time\u201d \u2013 a finding that smacks of politicians protecting one of their own. Yet it also found that she failed to show the parliamentary investigation due respect. They asked for an apology, which Mrs Miller gave in the House. It lasted just 32 seconds.\n\nWhether that was sufficient is not for the Prime Minister to decide. Yes, keeping her in the Cabinet is his call to make. But he cannot ignore the fact that a great many voters will still be troubled by how difficult it has been to get straight answers throughout this saga, and by the way in which the Culture Secretary has treated the standards system not as a means of keeping politics clean, but as a personal inconvenience.\n\nLet us not forget that Mrs Miller is also the minister in charge of future press regulation. The accusation has been made that this fact was used to make journalists back away from reporting on her expenses, which would be an indictment of the influence that press regulation by statute could have over free speech. The original expenses scandal was a tribute to the role that the press, unfettered by state control, can play in making sure democracy works on behalf of the people rather than the powerful. And if our MPs cannot hold an honest conversation about regulation of their own expenditure, how can we expect them to hold an honest conversation about the maintenance of the free press? Either way, questions about Mrs Miller\u2019s actions are unlikely to go away and many people will be asking themselves why the Prime Minister is standing so doggedly by her. Whatever Mr Cameron\u2019s motivation, he must surely understand that voters share his ambition for a cleaner politics and are willing him to take appropriate action. Alas, the expenses scandal is a manifestation of the lingering feeling that the gulf between the electors and the elected remains sizeable. This newspaper is passionate about continuing to expose wrongdoing where it occurs. Not for the sake simply of confirming the nihilist\u2019s lament that all power corrupts everyone but rather to help restore voters\u2019 faith in those politicians who really are decent, honest and accountable.",

                "text": "Alan Davie, who died on Saturday aged 93, was one of the great 20th-century British artists, a life-long maverick whose explosive canvases cut a swathe through the provincial aridity of the postwar art scene. The first British \u2013 probably the first European \u2013 artist to become aware of Pollock\u2019s innovations and take on the challenge of \u201caction painting\u201d, the quietly spoken but formidable Scot forged his own expressive path that was less an imitation of Pollock more, as fellow artist Peter Doig put it recently, \u201clike an expanded Paul Klee\u2026 but much more physical, much more visceral.\u201d\n\nAt the time of his breakthrough Whitechapel Gallery exhibition in 1958, Davie\u2019s improvisatory paintings were as \u201cout there\u201d as British art got. Monumental works such The Creation of Man and Sacrifice, 1956 (pictured below \u00a9 Tate) mixed an exuberant physicality with an ominous ritualistic quality that made the efforts of the closely related St Ives artists look positively prim in comparison. With his interests in jazz, Zen and chance, his desire to lose himself in the ocean of his own intuitive creativity, Davie was the nearest Britain ever got to producing a Beat artist.\n\nYet if his long red beard and quirky humour made him appear something of a wildman, Davie was reserved in a way that could appear arrogant, but masked a profound shyness. Indeed, while he was feted by Pollock, Rothko and Hockney and associated with the pan-European CoBrA movement, Davie wasn\u2019t interested in joining anybody else\u2019s club. He was content to explore the workings of his own mind and creative spirit in a private world that became increasingly removed from the art world mainstream \u2013 a propensity that was to be the undoing of his international reputation.\n\nAt art school the tutors were appalled by his refusal to tow the academic line, but he won every prize going\n\nWhile arguably less talented peers such as William Scott, Roger Hilton and Peter Lanyon became iconic figures, by the Eighties Davie was nearly forgotten.\n\nThe last decade, however, has seen a revival of interest in his work, with prices for early works rocketing. Now Davie can be seen as a great romantic individualist, the best of whose work stands beside anything produced by any British artist of the 20th century.\n\nJames Alan Davie was born in Grangemouth, Scotland, in 1920. His father was a teacher and artist of minor repute linked to the Glasgow School; many of his mother\u2019s family were professional musicians. By his own account a solitary child, the young Davie was equally talented in both fields, producing accomplished works in an adult manner, inspired by his father\u2019s books on Holbein, Goya and van Gogh, and teaching himself to play the saxophone after seeing American jazzman Coleman Hawkins playing in a local record shop.\n\nDavie\u2019s self-belief was bolstered by his father\u2019s encouragement of his apparently limitless talents. At art school the tutors were appalled by his refusal to tow the academic line, but he won every prize going. During war service in the Royal Artillery he wrote voluminous amounts of poetry, which his father faithfully typed out and bound in exquisite hand-made books. On demob he became a professional jazz musician, touring as featured tenor sax player with leading Scottish big bands. (Pictured below: Birth of Venus, 1955 \u00a9 Tate)\n\nBut on meeting the love of his life, fellow art student Janet Gaul known as Bili, who he soon married, he jacked it all in and embarked on a romantic journey through Europe, funded by an academic travel scholarship. It was an experience which, through an unlikely chain of occurrences, launched his career as an artist.\n\nAt the Venice Biennale, the first since the war, he saw huge exhibitions of Picasso and Klee and the work of the New York painters, which was then barely known in Europe. Davie began painting in earnest, working on big rolls of paper on the floors of cheap hotel rooms. He held exhibitions in Florence and Venice, where he came to the attention of stellar collector Peggy Guggenheim, who was astonished that works of such visceral intensity could have been produced by a British artist.\n\nOn Guggenheim\u2019s recommendation, Davie was taken on by Gimpel Fils, then London\u2019s top avant-garde art gallery, though he didn\u2019t sell a single painting during his first seven years with the them. Living in the Abbey Art Centre, a sort of proto-commune in New Barnet, Davie survived by making pre-Columbian-inspired jewellery by day and playing jazz in London clubs by night \u2013 while his abstract, yet intensely bodily paintings were resolutely ignored by the British art world. (Pictured below: Fairy Tree, 1971 \u00a9 Tate)\n\nYet from the time of his debut New York exhibition at the Catherine Viviano Gallery in 1956, at which every work sold, Davie\u2019s career was on an unstoppable upward trajectory, culminating in his 1958 Whitechapel exhibition.\n\nWith their exhilarating colour and joyous, almost childlike exuberance, Davie\u2019s paintings of the Sixties are as representative of the spirit of that tumultuous decade as anything by Hockney or Blake. But tastes in art were changing: expressive abstraction was out. Yet if the focus of the art world had moved away from him, Davie didn\u2019t care \u2013 or certainly not initially. Still exhibiting and selling, with homes in Hertfordshire, Cornwall and St Lucia, he was happy to plough his own furrow in works that became less improvisatory, more structured and drew increasingly on non-European art \u2013 African, Indian, Aboriginal, Native American \u2013 of which he had a superb collection.\n\nWhile this drew criticism that he absorbed every culture except his own, he was also fascinated by western Outsider Art, graffiti and tattoos. Indeed, in his final years, he came to see himself increasingly as an outsider artist, a unique figure who was beyond the boundaries of the Western mainstream.\n\nThis self-assessment was in some ways accurate: for Davie art was an involuntary, biological urge, something he felt impelled to do regardless of other people\u2019s tastes or opinions. And yet at the same his work represents a vital moment in the development of international art, a kind of psychic opening-out after the trauma of the Second World War, an embracing of new possibilities and new freedoms, a global mood that is best expressed \u2013 certainly in British art \u2013 in the work of Alan Davie.",

He also wrote poetry during the 1940s and, from 1953 to 1956, taught at London's Central School of Arts and Crafts.\n\nBy the 1960s, he had returned to painting and his work showed an interest in \"myth\", as well as symbolically representing birth, procreation and death \"in many cultures\", according to the Tate.\n\n\"I work in a great variety of styles and I don't make a distinction in the way I paint. All my images are made in order to uncover the hidden unknown,\" said Davie.\n\nThe Tate said he named his works after finishing them and that he came up with the title Birth of Venus, one of his artworks, after seeing in it \"a distinct suggestion of the primeval womb, birth place, cavern, source of fruitfulness and love\".",

His kaleidoscopic canvases, the result of an improvisatory process that the artist relates to his love of jazz, form a complex web of imagery that evoke a magical world of imagination and personal mythology.\"\n\nPollock, Rothko and Hockney were all fans of Davie's expressive abstraction painting style. But he drifted into obscurity by the Seventies, and only recently has there been a big resurgence of interest in Davie's work.\n\nDuring what turned out to be his last published interview, with The Telegraph's Mark Hudson, Davie said of his art: \"It\u2019s an urge, an intensity, a kind of sexual need. I don\u2019t practice painting or drawing as an art, in the sense of artifice, of making an imitation of something. It\u2019s something I do from an inner compulsion, that has to come out.\"\n\nREAD: Alan Davie's last interview - 'art is an urge, an intensity, a kind of sexual need'",

I think he was very unlucky and it's good he jumped straight out of the car.\"\n\nDespite the heavy force of the impact, Gutierrez was able to clamber out of his stricken C33 and was taken to the circuit's medical centre for mandatory checks. Sauber tweeted later that \"everything is fine\" with the 22-year-old.",

                "text": "Sebastian Vettel is optimistic Red Bull will be able to recover from their midfield grid positions in the Bahrain GP after problems on his car in qualifying compounded Daniel Ricciardo's grid penalty for the World Champions.\n\nFor the second time in three races since the start of the season Vettel failed to progress through Q2 with the German's pace compromised by glitches with his RB10's gearbox and lingering problems which left him down on power on Sakhir's array of straights.\n\nWith team-mate Ricciardo already carrying a ten-place grid penalty into the weekend after Red Bull's unsafe pit release in Malaysia, it means that the World Champions' two cars will line up in the unfamiliar positions of tenth and 13th - their worst combined result since last year's Chinese GP.\n\nVettel, who gained a position courtesy of Ricciardo's drop from an otherwise encouraging third on the grid, missed out on the top-ten shootout by a mere six hundredths of a second, although the German chose not to wholly blame his car's problems for his early exit.\n\n\"We had some issues with the shifts for some reason from one run to the other, from the final run of Q1 to Q2,\" the World Champion explained to reporters.\n\n\"Something went wrong and we couldn't fix it in time so I had to do the lap compromised. How much it affected the lap is difficult to measure but surely it was no help.\n\n\"The car behaviour wasn't the way I expected and the way I wanted. But I'm not a fan of blaming something in particular. For sure that didn't help, without it for sure yes I would have made it to Q3, but still it was not the session that we wanted to have this evening.\"\n\nAs well as losing a \"little bit of performance down the straights\" owing to issues with his RB10's wastegate, Vettel had earlier lost running time in Practice Three after spinning off the circuit - an incident he admitted had come about because of driver error.\n\nYet despite his problematic Saturday, Vettel believes both he and Ricciardo will be able to come through the field to some extent over the 57 laps of racing.\n\n\"It depends who I have to overtake, but I think it's always possible,\" he insisted.\n\n\"I hope we find the right strategy to make sure we can use the pace of the car. Once we are in free air we should be fine but obviously it's a bit easier to be in free air when you start from pole rather than tenth.\"\n\nBut while Red Bull might harbour hope of fighting their way back towards the top five, any challenge for the very top positions at Sakhir had already looked forlorn prior to qualifying given Mercedes' large pace advantage over the field.\n\nVettel conceded the dominance of the W05s hadn't come as a surprise.\n\n\"We felt already in testing that it's a difficult track for us,\" he admitted.\n\n\"We are down on power so around here you need some power. That's how it is. I think for tomorrow nevertheless we had a good chance to put the car in a fairly good place in the points.\"\n\nSky Sports F1's exclusively live coverage of the Bahrain GP begins at 2.30pm UK Time, with the race underway at 4pm",

                "text": "This summer I went hiking several times in California's Eastern Sierra. Each time I went I counted the number of male to female hikers and ended up with a 5:1 ratio. This reflects many women's experience of the wilderness and outdoor sports such as rock climbing or mountaineering. These are male-dominated arenas.\n\nOne of the reasons for that is because these activities are advertised to women as an escape from their stressful lives, not as a sport meant to challenge their physical ability. Outdoors equipment marketed towards women, then, consistently focuses on comfort and style, in contrast to men's marketing. Moreover, much of the gear that is produced for women assumes less of a desire to do activities that are as physically demanding as men -- the gear is often less hardy and more decorative. The assumptions behind these marketing strategies reinforce stereotypical ideas of gender: that women are physically weak, that women are fascinated by fashion, that there is one specific female body type, and that women are \"soft.\"\n\nOsprey is generally acknowledged as the maker of the best backpacks for hiking and backpacking. Their top-of-the-line backpack for long multi-day backpack trips for men, the Xenith, can hold 105 L and between 60-80 lbs. The women's pack, the Xena, on the other hand, can hold 85 L and between 50-70 lbs. This is because the women's pack is shorter. Osprey is betting that most women have a shorter torso and thus need a shorter pack. While this might be true for some women, they could attempt to engineer another type of pack that would allow women to carry the same poundage as men. Moreover, it is unclear why these packs are labeled \"men's and women's.\" Plenty of women have longer torsos and men shorter ones. And, indeed, on backpacking forums on the internet, you constantly see stories of people buying gear of the \"wrong sex\" so that it actually fits.\n\nMany hikers and backpackers buy gear online and oftentimes the structure of the websites of the major companies who sell gear reveals the companies' assumptions about the interests of their consumers. Some, such as Arc'teryx, open their websites with gender distinctions. One must choose men's or women's products immediately upon going to their site. Other companies, such as REI, open their site with the opportunity to choose an activity, such as hiking, climbing, cycling, running, etc. or sex category, which is better. By so dividing their products, Arc'teryx is making it harder for those who need to buy gear from the \"wrong\" sex or to market unisex gear while REI is making consumers feel part of a larger community of climbers or backpackers or hikers.\n\nThe marketing of backpacking gear is itself highly gendered, with women's gear being presented as comfortable and stylish. Oddly, it is not marketed with an eye towards serious wilderness excursions. Take, for example, the Yumalina pant manufactured by Mountain Hardwear. The men's version is described as \"Durable softshell seriously protects on the outside, while lightweight fleece on the inside keeps you warm on those chilly hikes\" while the women's version is described as \"Serious on the outside and soft on fuzzy on the inside. Perfect for work or play during the winter.\" The women's pant is thus not seen as for someone who is serious about backpacking.\n\nThe naming and color palette of much women's gear also reflects the idea in the backpacking industry that women needed to be treated delicately. Black Diamond, which manufactures popular rock climbing harnesses, has named their women's harnesses \"Primrose,\" \"Siren,\" \"Aura,\" and \"Lotus,\" emphasizing the stereotypical connection between women and flowers and sexuality. Women are connected to passive agents. The harnesses themselves are typically in pastel colors as well. This is in contrast to the men's harnesses, which are named \"Chaos,\" \"Focus,\" \"Flight,\" and \"Momentum,\" which are strikingly active words in comparison and are designed in bright, bold colors.\n\nAs Brendan Leonard points out in his post, Girly Girls and Manly Men, \"No company feels like they have to do anything special to men's gear, or 'masculinize it' it. Yoga is arguably maybe the most feminine (or just female-dominated) of any active pursuit, but you don't see any companies making yoga mats with patterns on them that look like cascades of hammers or football helmets or beer mugs, to encourage men by saying, 'It's OK, dude. You can own one of these and still love Home Depot.'\" Why do companies thus feel that women cannot be serious backpackers, hikers or climbers without feminized gear?\n\nAdrianne Wadewitz, PhD is a Mellon Digital Scholarship Postdoctoral Fellow at Occidental College specializing in emerging media from the 18th-century to the present.

                "text": "There are many things that we should congratulate Cholo Simeone for, from making Atl\u00e9tico a great club again through to making Koke and Diego Costa the players they are today.\n\n1/ An Atl\u00e9tico side that's respected in Europe. Many years ago, Alt\u00e9tico were always in the fight to win the league and were a force to be feared around Europe. It's been a full 40 years since they last made it to the semi-finals of the European Cup.\n\n2/ The value of a footballing philosophy. There are many ways of earning respect. And Atl\u00e9tico have more fight in them than anyone else, making the most of their resources and placing the good of the team above anything else.\n\n3/ Super Koke. If one player has developed more than any other with Cholo then that's Koke. Two years ago, he was a regular bench warmer and these days he's the beating heart of the Atl\u00e9tico and Spain teams.\n\n4/ The importance of the coach. Just in case anyone was in any doubt, you just need to have a look at Simeone's work with this Atl\u00e9tico side to see that the role of the coach is fundamental. Although there's a risk in saying this during a World Cup year, the Ballon d'Or for best manager should go to Cholo this year.\n\n5/ Diego Costa. Before Simeone arrived, the new member of the Spain squad didn't stand out from the crowd. Today, he's one of the best strikers in the world and everyone at the Calder\u00f3n has forgotten about Falcao. Atl\u00e9tico is irresistible with Costa leading the line.\n\n6/ Using the full squad. Atl\u00e9tico is a team through and through. Those who get less playing time have still given their all when it has really mattered. Getting them fired up and involved has been another great achievement of the manager.\n\n7/ Villa and the World Cup. Cholo used Villa in his starting eleven early on in the season, then relegated him to the bench. But he's once again giving the Spain international a starring role in this decisive period. Villa is earning himself a spot on that plane to Brazil.\n\n8/ Drawing level with the noisy neighbours. Simeone has managed to end an era of being completely dominated by Real. Overcoming 'Los Blancos' at the Bernab\u00e9u in last year's cup final and currently sitting ahead of them in the league means that 15 years of derby dominance has finally drawn to an end in Madrid.\n\n9/ Nobody is talking about the 'sh**ty league' anymore. Seeing Alt\u00e9tico up there battling it out with the powerhouses of Spanish football is the best news ever for the league, which has been a two-horse race for too long. Despite being a different type of package, Atl\u00e9tico are now on the same level as Real and Bar\u00e7a.\n\n10/ The Calder\u00f3n dares to dream. Nobody is accusing them of being whingers anymore and Atl\u00e9tico fans can once more be proud of their team. Cholo's Atl\u00e9tico side is a side of winners, and the Calder\u00f3n is loving life again after many long years of suffering.",

Southampton's Jay Rodriguez was a fringe player said to be in serious contention for a place in 's squad, per Adam of the Daily Mail.\n\nHowever, his dream of a place on the plane to Brazil looks to be all but over after he suffered a serious knee injury whilst trying to control an innocuous-looking high ball.\n\nPlay was stopped for four minutes before the player was carried off on a stretcher in tears.\n\nBrazil have to be considered amongst the favourites for the tournament, and not just because of home advantage.\n\nThey are well-organised, and in Luis Felipe they have a manager who has been there and done it all before, after leading the triumph in 2002.\n\nA star-studded squad they may be, but they work hard in all areas of the pitch, and as long as they take that work ethic into the tournament, then reaching the latter stages is certainly not beyond them.\n\nIf there is anyone to threaten a home win, it is Brazil's South American neighbours Argentina.\n\nIn Lionel , they have arguably the world's best player. The game-changer. Brazil will be only too aware of what the diminutive striker brings to the table, too:\n\nAlthough the focus of Argentina's play is likely to surround , it is his team-mates who should help bring him the glory which many believe he needs to define himself as the best to have ever played the game.\n\nGonzalo , Angel Di Maria, Sergio , Javier . The list goes on. One of the strongest squads in the tournament need to step up to ensure success in the backyard of their fiercest rivals.\n\nSpain come into the tournament as titleholders and seek to retain the trophy.

                "text": "Cynthia Ashley-Nelson died yesterday. She was attending the Wikimedia Conference as an AffCom member, and on Thursday had participated on her first annual AffCom meeting. The news about her death have surprised and shocked the people at the conference. I realise there are many people who might not be familiar with her, so I wanted to write a few words about her and the impact she made on those who knew her.\n\nIn my role as Board liaison to the Affiliations Committee, I had seen Cindy, as her friends called her, apply to become a member, and how she was finally elected to the committee. She had such a solid background, so relevant to the work AffCom does, she was such strong candidate, it was a no brainer for AffCom to elect her. They were not disappointed. Cindy was participative, incredibly engaged from the first day on the work of the committee and looking beyond it, trying to improve existing processes and thinking ahead about expanding AffCom\u2019s role. She had wonderful ideas and a refreshing perspective regarding movement roles and the role of AffCom. One that I especially liked was her desire to implement a thorough Affiliate Development Program, to help guide new affiliates and teach them relevant skills so they could not only be better equiped to survive, but to thrive, and have a bigger impact in a shorter period of time.\n\nI got to know Cindy a bit beyond that, for she wanted to test ideas and potential directions in which to take the movement. We would send each other long emails about movement roles and how to move forward with the movement. And as it usually happens, conversations turned from the more formal to the informal, eventually including little snippets of our every day lives, the good things that happened to us and the not so good. When we met for the first time face to face two days ago, we gave each other a big hug. In the session we had during the AffCom meeting she once again showed her passion and commitment to help reimagine the role of AffCom and how to help emerging and new affiliates. And at the end of that session, she was confirmed as the new vice-chair of AffCom. That speaks to the impact she made inside the committee in such a short time. I think our last interaction was about getting together at some moment during the conference to just hang out and talk. She had a great smile.\n\nWhen the tragic news came in last night during dinner, so out of the blue, I was shocked. Literally shocked. She had missed the meeting between AffCom and the Board, which was very surprising, and it hadn\u2019t been possible to contact her, but it didn\u2019t necessarily make one think something bad had happened. When the Board was notified of what had happened, we wanted to be very respectful about the fact that the priority had to be to contact the next of kin before any kind of public announcement or tweet or anything was released. But AffCom had to be told. I had been an AffCom member before joining the Board. Breaking the news to them was one of the hardest things I\u2019ve done in this movement. We went to a room to deal with the shock and the reactions. Nobody wanted to be alone.\n\nThis morning after the next of kin had been located and notified, we all got together for breakfast and went together to the venue where a grief counsellor was available. There was a brief but touching tribute at the beginning of the conference, and then AffCom prepared a public statement to inform about Cindy\u2019s death. I felt my place was with them, helping them word it. As the schedule was reorganised, I missed the Meet the Board session which was moved to the morning, which I deeply regret, but I did want to be with AffCom in these moments. I want people to know I will be available for anyone who wants to ask me anything about the Board or the movement at the venue. I just couldn\u2019t make it this morning. Before ending this post, I would like to take a moment to thank the people of WMDE, who were incredible in such difficult circumstances and who set up a special room to grieve for her and write in a book of condolences, particularly Pavel, and WMF staff, especially Anasuya, Garfield and Asaf. The support of Board members was deeply appreciated as well, not only by me but by AffCom as well.\n\nThis post is perhaps a bit cathartic for me. Cindy, you made an impact in those who knew you and you will be remembered. My thoughts are with the family and friends. Rest in peace.",

He currently is serving a 41-month federal prison term in Pennsylvania.\n\nOn Thursday, the US court of appeals for the third circuit threw out Auernheimer\u2019s conviction, ruling that New Jersey, where he was tried, was an improper venue for the case. The issue of venue is particularly sensitive in computer fraud trials, which by nature transcend physical jurisdictions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re scrambling right now to figure out how to get him out,\u201d said defense attorney Tor Ekeland in a telephone interview. \u201cRight now we\u2019re just focused on getting him out, because they\u2019ve been holding him in a special housing unit, which is a 6x11 cell, where he only gets out one hour a day.\u201d\n\nEkeland, who took on Auernheimer\u2019s case in November 2011 after his wife met Auernheimer at the Occupy Wall Street protest, said the defense team was gratified by the circuit court\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome news. It\u2019s everything we\u2019ve been working really hard for for the last couple years,\u201d Ekeland said. \u201cWe always said, from day one, that the venue was improper in New Jersey, it was one of the first things we raised with the government. We stuck with that through trial.\u201d\n\nAuernheimer was charged with a felony under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), the same statute that was used to prosecute internet activist Aaron Swartz. Critics say the law was meant to prosecute larger crimes and its use in hacking cases was an intimidation tactic by the government.\n\nAuernheimer\u2019s legal team argued at trial that his prosecution under the CFAA was improper, but Ekeland said he was just as happy to see the conviction vacated on venue grounds.\n\n\u201cIn terms of venue, it\u2019s an incredibly important concept, and the government\u2019s prosecution here just threw that out the window,\u201d Ekeland said.\n\n\u201cIf the court had ruled the other way, you would have had universal venue in these kinds of cases, computer fraud and abuse cases, and that would have had huge implications for the Internet and computer law.\n\n\u201cI think this is a very, very important venue decision when it comes to the Internet and computer law, and I\u2019m quite happy about it.\u201d\n\nEkeland said he never got a full explanation from the government of why it brought the case in New Jersey. The circuit court found an \u201cabsence of any apparent connection to New Jersey, noting that at the time of the alleged crime, an alleged accomplice of Auernheimer\u2019s \u201cwas in San Francisco, California, and Auernheimer was in Fayetteville, Arkansas. The servers that they accessed were physically located in Dallas, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I asked them about [venue] in one of our first meetings, I thought they would show me something,\u201d Ekeland said. \u201cBut they never showed me anything, so I kept pushing it all the way through trial.\n\n\u201cAnd we pushed it on appeal, and we won on it.\u201d",

                "text": "San Francisco - A federal appeals court overturned the conviction of Andrew \"weev\" Auernheimer, the computer researcher who was charged with violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) after he exposed a massive security flaw in AT&T's website.\n\nAuernheimer was represented on appeal by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Professor Orin Kerr of George Washington University, and attorneys Marcia Hofmann, and Tor Ekeland. In an opinion issued this morning by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Judge Michael Chagares wrote that the government should not have charged Auernheimer in New Jersey, which had no direct connection to AT&T or Auernheimer.\n\n\"We're thrilled that the Third Circuit reversed Mr. Auernheimer's conviction,\" EFF Staff Attorney Hanni Fakhoury said. \"This prosecution presented real threats to security research. Hopefully this decision will reassure that community.\"\n\nIn 2010, Auernheimer's co-defendant, Daniel Spitler, discovered that AT&T had configured its servers to make the email addresses of iPad owners publicly available on the Internet. Spitler wrote a script and collected roughly 114,000 email addresses as a result of the security flaw. Auernheimer then distributed the list of email addresses to media organizations as proof of the vulnerability, ultimately forcing AT&T to acknowledge and fix the security problem.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged Auernheimer and Spitler with identity theft and conspiracy to violate the CFAA in New Jersey federal court. Spitler accepted a plea deal, while Auernheimer unsuccessfully fought the charges in a jury trial. Auernheimer began serving a 41-month prison sentence in March 2013.\n\nOn appeal, Auernheimer's defense team argued that accessing a publicly available website does not constitute unauthorized access to a computer under the CFAA. They also argued that Auernheimer should not have been charged in New Jersey. At the time they were obtaining email addresses, Auernheimer was in Arkansas, Spitler was in California and AT&T's servers were in Georgia and Texas.\n\nThe court agreed with Auernheimer that charging the case in New Jersey was improper and reversed his conviction and ordered him released from prison. Although it did not directly address whether accessing information on a publicly available website violates the CFAA, the court suggested that there may have been no CFAA violation, since no code-based restrictions to access had been circumvented.\n\n\"Today's decision is important beyond weev's specific case,\" added Fakhoury. \"The court made clear that the location of a criminal defendant remains an important constitutional limitation, even in today's Internet age.\"",

Close\n\nUkrainian Army troops receive munitions at a field on the outskirts of Izyum, Eastern Ukraine, on April 15, 2014.\n\nUkraine unleashed an offensive to dislodge militants from cities in the eastern Donetsk region as authorities in the capital Kiev said Russian special forces were identified among the anti-government groups.\n\nFrom four to 11 militants were killed and two wounded when Ukrainian troops stormed an airfield in Kramatorsk, taking it under control, Russian state television reported. Ukrainian units backed by armored personnel carriers blocked all approaches to the town of Slovyansk, the Russian state news service RIA Novosti said, citing a pro-Russian activist. Elements of Russia\u2019s 45th Airborne Regiment were spotted in both towns, Ukrainian First Deputy Prime Minister Vitali Yarema said on Channel 5.\n\nThe government in Kiev is taking the battle to the restive east of the country after armed pro-Russian activists occupied administrative buildings in cities including Donetsk, a regional center about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the Russian border. An attempt to head off the mounting insurgency may escalate tensions with Russia, which warned of a potential civil war. NATO says Russia has 40,000 troops massed on Ukraine\u2019s border after its annexation of Crimea last month.\n\nFull coverage of the Crisis in Ukraine:\n\n\u201cThe aim of these actions is to protect people,\u201d acting President Oleksandr Turchynov said in a statement on his website. \u201cApart from Russian special forces and terrorists, there\u2019s hundreds of thousands of innocent Ukrainian people deceived by Russian propaganda, and that is why we will take any needed anti-terrorist actions prudently and responsibly.\u201d\n\nRussian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Facebook that \u201cblood was spilled once again in Ukraine. There\u2019s a sense in the country that a civil war could break out.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s benchmark Micex Index of equities declined 2.5 percent to 1,311.01, extending its retreat since the takeover of Crimea started on March 1 to 9.3 percent.\n\nThe ruble weakened 0.5 percent to 36.1500 against the dollar, extending its drop since Feb. 28 to 0.7 percent.\n\nIn Washington, the Obama administration left open the door to providing some form of military aid to Ukraine.\n\nPressed on whether the U.S. is considering sending equipment such as armored vests or night-vision goggles, White House press secretary Jay Carney said only that lethal equipment, which would include weapons, is \u201cnot something we\u2019re currently considering.\u201d Economic aid for Ukraine is the main focus for the U.S., he said.\n\nPoland\u2019s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said today in an interview with Polish broadcaster TVN24 that Putin has \u201ca credibility problem\u201d in denying Russian troops are in Ukraine after similar denials in Crimea proved to be false.\n\nSikorski said that the U.S. is \u201cseriously considering\u201d stationing ground forces in Poland as part of an effort to bolster North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces in eastern Europe.\n\nThe deadly clashes have prompted diverging views from Russia and the U.S. Speaking with United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, President Vladimir Putin called the events \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and demanded international condemnation of the crackdown, according to a statement e-mailed by the Russian leader\u2019s press service.\n\nThe U.S. is \u201cadmiring\u201d the restraint show by Ukraine, with Russia directly and indirectly supporting the provocations, said Carney, the White House spokesman.\n\n\u201cUkraine had no option,\u201d Ievgen Vorobiov, analyst at the Warsaw-based Polish Institute of Foreign Affairs, said by phone from Kiev. \u201cThe government\u2019s hand was forced into a very uncomfortable decision, even if it fits into the Russian plan. This strike will send Russia a clear signal that the Ukrainian government isn\u2019t ready to pull out of Donetsk and Luhansk.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. and Russia plan to proceed with four-party talks in Geneva with European Union and Ukrainian officials in two days, even as the EU and the U.S. are considering widening sanctions against Russian individuals and possibly companies.\n\nAdded sanctions aren\u2019t likely to be imposed until after the Geneva meeting, Jen Psaki, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman told reporters in Washington today.\n\nUkraine must stop quashing protests and hold a referendum on devolving power to regions, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quoted as saying by RIA in Beijing today. He said using force could jeopardize the talks.\n\n\u201cRussia is in an excellent bargaining position before the start of talks,\u201d Gary Greenberg, who oversees about $785 million in emerging-market stocks at Hermes Fund Managers Ltd., said in a phone interview from London. \u201cHaving provocateurs in Ukraine or having the Ukrainian government forces start shooting puts Russia in much stronger position in its negotiating dance with Europe and the U.S. This is part of their strategy.\u201d\n\nPutin, who plans to hold a televised call-in news conference on April 17, is getting appeals for help from eastern Ukrainians alongside questions about why Russia isn\u2019t taking action, his spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters today. Putin has parliamentary approval to deploy troops in Ukraine to protect the rights of Russian-speakers and those of Russian heritage.\n\nIn making a possible decision to invade Ukraine, \u201cit will only be to protect Ukrainian citizens,\u201d Putin told reporters last month.\n\nThe U.S. and the EU are drawing up plans for more sanctions against Russia, as Putin and President Barack Obama remained at odds over who was at fault. The U.S. and EU states say Russia is behind the turmoil that has fueled their worst standoff since the Cold War. Russia denies involvement and says the government in Kiev isn\u2019t protecting Russian-speaking citizens.\n\nAt least 20 armored personnel carriers and two helicopters were stationed at a post on the border of Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, with four buses filled with troops seen in the area.\n\nIn a phone conversation with Putin last night, Obama \u201cexpressed grave concern about Russian government support for the actions of armed, pro-Russian separatists.\u201d He urged Putin to get them to withdraw from facilities they seized, according to a White House statement. Putin told Obama he should \u201cuse the American side\u2019s capabilities to prevent the use of force and bloodshed as much as possible,\u201d according to a Kremlin statement.\n\nEU ministers meeting in Luxembourg yesterday added four Ukrainians to the list of people being sanctioned, including former deputy Prime Minister Serhiy Arbuzov. EU sanctions now cover 55 Ukrainians and Russians.\n\nThe bloc indicated it will widen the blacklist to target people and possibly groups or companies responsible for destabilization in eastern Ukraine. Any sign that Russian troops were crossing into eastern or southern Ukraine would be a trigger for the European Union to impose economic sanctions, according to Hungarian Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi.\n\n\u201cIf Russian troops cross the border -- a military incursion or invasion -- into eastern or southern Ukraine, that would suddenly be a cause for launching stage three, economic sanctions, or targeted measures,\u201d Martonyi said in an interview today in Brussels.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Jake Rudnitsky in Moscow at jrudnitsky@bloomberg.net; James G.

                "text": "DONETSK, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine launched a military operation against pro-Russia separatists Tuesday in a region close to the Russian border despite warnings from Moscow to leave the insurgents alone.\n\n\"It will be conducted step by step, responsibly, cautiously,\" Ukraine President Oleksandr Turchynov told the country's parliament shortly before the operation began.\n\n\"The aim of these actions is to protect the citizens of Ukraine, to stop terror, to stop criminality, to stop attempts to tear Ukraine to pieces,\" he said.\n\nRussia was lashed by the United Nations and the West for escalating the crisis by publicly encouraging the separatists and threatening to invade under the false pretext that ethnic Russians were in danger.\n\nThe first apparent action of the Ukraine offensive was the retaking of a small airfield near the town Kramatorsk, in the eastern Ukraine region of Donetsk. Russian state television reported that as many as 11 people had been killed; Ukraine said there were no deaths.\n\nKramatorsk is about 100 miles from the Russian border, where thousands of Russian military troops, tank columns and fighter jets are based. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned Ukraine that he may intercede to protect ethnic Russians, though it is ethnic Russians who have been the ones forcing their way into government buildings.\n\nRussia warned Kiev against using force against the pro-Russia protesters and denied charges from Ukraine that the unrest is being whipped up by paid operatives and special forces from Russia.\n\n\"This is a total lie that supposes that those residents there are completely incapable of protesting of their own will,'' Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Tuesday after talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.\n\nLavrov said Moscow may walk out of an international conference on the Ukraine to be held Thursday in Geneva. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon spoke with Putin by phone and urged him to de-escalate\" his actions, Ban's press office said.\n\n\"The secretary-general ... underlined that any deepening of the crisis would be profoundly detrimental for all concerned,'' Ban's office said.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin told Ban that \"The Russian side expects a clear condemnation from the United Nations and the international community of these anti-constitutional actions.\" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said that it's Russia that is to be condemned.\n\n\"In recent days Russia has deliberately pushed Ukraine to the brink, and created a still greater risk of violent confrontation.\" The White House appeared to back the Ukrainian military action.\n\n\"The Ukrainian government has the responsibility to provide law and order and these provocations in eastern Ukraine are creating a situation in which the government has to respond,'' White House spokesman Jay Carney said.\n\nHe said the United States is \"seriously considering'' new sanctions against Russia to stop it from giving legitimacy to the takeovers of Ukraine buildings by pro-Russia Ukrainians.\n\nThe pro-Russia occupiers are demanding that a referendum be held to secede and join Russia, and they are urging Russian forces to invade as they did in Crimea. The Ukraine province of Crimea has been overtaken militarily by Putin, who annexed it into Russia despite warnings from President Obama of \"repercussions\" if he did so.\n\nRoads into Slovyansk, a city west of Russia, were dotted with checkpoints maned by pro-Russia men. One at the entrance into town was waving a Russian flag.\n\nNumerous news media reports of armored personnel carriers with Ukrainian flags parked alongside roads in Donetsk. Other heavy military equipment appeared nearby, along with at least seven busloads of government troops in black military fatigues.\n\n\"We are awaiting the order to move on Sloyvansk,\" said one soldier, who gave only his first name, Taras.\n\nPresident Turchynov said those who do not surrender will be arrested. \"I'm convinced that there will not be any terrorists left soon in Donetsk and other regions and they will find themselves in the dock \u2014 this is where they belong,\" he said.\n\nTurchynov accused Russia of fueling the unrest in eastern Ukraine by infiltrating the country with Russian special forces who are aiding separatists. Russian speaking masked men, well-armed and in matching uniforms bearing no insignias, have been seen helping the occupiers build barricades to keep Ukraine troops from forcing them out.\n\nUkraine's government has hinted that it is willing to consider granting more autonomy to regions in the east but not independence. Close to half of the people in the east are ethnic Russians.\n\nBut independent polls, one conducted by Gallup last month, show a majority of people in the east and south do not want to become part of Russia. A majority of Crimeans responded the same way.\n\n\"I'm not happy because of these events,\" said Vladimir Ivaschenko in Donetsk. \"I'd like to live in a normal Ukraine and without any influence from Russia or from west side.\n\n\"It seems like Russian tanks are going to enter Ukraine. Separatists already called for Russian help,\" he said.\n\nOthers feel the central government in Kiev has not heeded the wishes of populations in the east and is to blame for the unrest.\n\n\"I am worried with our central power and I am worried about a new split between Ukrainians,\" said Olga Chuvaeva, also from Donetsk. \"Western Ukraine always hated Russia. They don't hear us. Here, in Donetsk, we never hated western Ukraine.\"\n\nFacing economic stress, Ukraine's central bank increased its benchmark interest rate from 7% to 14.5% to prevent massive inflation due to the record lows of its currency.\n\nRussia's state-owned gas industry has threatened to cut off supplies to Ukraine, prompting German utility company RWE AG on Tuesday to start supplying gas to Ukraine via Poland.\n\nContributing: Doug Stanglin in McLean, Va., Luigi Serenelli in Berlin, Associated Press",

                "text": "Scientists at Chicago's Field Museum and international collaborators have reconstructed the phylogeny and biological history for the Yellow-shouldered bats in the New World tropics, the region of the Earth surrounding the equator. In-depth analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences uncovered three species new to science, each having previously been confused with another species. Since 1960, when modern studies on this group began, Sturnira has grown from eight species to 22. The newest additions were described in a new study, published online in ZooKeys.\n\nThe New World tropics have long been recognized as a region teeming with some of the richest biodiversity on Earth. It is home to a group of small, fruit-eating bats ranging from half-an-ounce to three ounces in size. The bats belong to the genus Sturnira, commonly named yellow-shouldered bats, which are found from northern Mexico to northern Argentina. One species in particular, Sturnira lilium, has figured among the most widespread and locally abundant bats of the New World topics.\n\n\"A curator's job is to bring order out of chaos,\" said Bruce Patterson, PhD, MacArthur Curator of Mammals at The Field Museum. \"This group of bats offered an excellent opportunity study the process of species formation across the entire New World tropics.\"\n\nPa\u00fal Velazco, PhD, who formerly worked at The Field Museum and now is with the American Museum of Natural History in New York, is the lead author on the new study. Velazco and Patterson began their endeavor by collecting 38 samples of six species from three countries. They also borrowed 94 samples from 24 countries from museums around the world in order to complete the project, highlighting the importance of museum collections for the growing body of scientific knowledge.\n\nThe researchers isolated DNA from a small portion of liver or muscle samples that had been frozen or preserved from each specimen. They then amplified and sequenced two nuclear and three mitochondrial genes from each tissue, amounting to nearly 5,000 base pairs of DNA, from over 120 individuals.\n\n\"We chose these genes because they have proven useful for classification of related groups of bats,\" said Velazco. \"Mitochondrial sequences tend to be fast-evolving and informative about very recent evolutionary splits, while nuclear genes tend to be slow-evolving and shed light on more ancient divergence events.\"\n\nBy sequencing both classes of DNA, the researchers could recover the group's entire history, which stretches back about 8 million years.\n\nEvery museum specimen that was sequenced already had both a name and a geographic distribution. However, the sequence analysis led the investigators to believe that some of the branch labels were incorrect. Indeed, after re-examining the museum specimens associated with each sample, they found that nearly 20 percent of the specimens had been incorrectly labeled!\n\nHow could so many individual animals have been misidentified? The answer lies within technology.\n\n\"The differences between species are often subtle, and difficult to describe in writing. The historic literature lacked access to the visual documentation that we rely on today, such as color photography and digital libraries,\" said Patterson. \"For this reason, small and imprecisely described morphological differences were often overlooked during the original identification of the specimens. This type of error pervades all biological collections.\"\n\nTheir results identified three species entirely new to science, and provided evidence for the elevation of three subspecies to the species level. Two of the new species are described in the ZooKeys article.\n\nIn the process, Velazco and Patterson were able to revise the supposed geographic range of Sturnira lilium. Instead of extending from Mexico to Argentina, the real Sturnira lilium is limited to Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and northern Argentina. The rest of its presumed range is occupied by six other close relatives that replace one another in jigsaw-like fashion across the Neotropics.\n\nThe distribution of Sturnira species across most of the New World tropics and its diversification throughout its eight-million-year existence make it informative for other sorts of biological reconstructions, such as the seed plants upon which it feeds.\n\nIn addition to its scientific usefulness, this study demonstrates the need for the ongoing revision of the Earth's biological history, and highlights the immense value of museum collections in uncovering new knowledge.\n\n\"For this particular group of mammals, we are much closer that we were in framing their diversity, although there may be additional Sturnira out there,\" said Patterson. \"Over the years, I've learned that no one has the last word in science.\"\n\n",

It was a marvel,\u201d tweeted Industry Minister James Moore.\n\n\u201cHe caught every fastball we threw with his bare hand and smiled \u2014 first to our frustration, then to our rhetorical astonishment and respect.\u201d\n\nConstituents, however, said he was a down-to-earth politician who always looked beyond party lines when it came to their concerns.\n\nThe Windsor lawyer was first elected to the Commons in 1962 at the age of 31.\n\nHe would remain undefeated for 12 successive elections in his Windsor West riding. In the November 2000 election, he captured over 20,000 votes, more than twice that of his nearest competitor.\n\nGray became the first Jewish federal cabinet minister in Canadian history, appointed as minister without portfolio by Pierre Trudeau, the prime minister of the day. He later held various cabinet portfolios including national revenue, consumer and corporate affairs and industry.\n\nHe took over as deputy prime minister in 1997 from Sheila Copps when she resigned amid a scandal over the Liberals\u2019 unfilled promise to scrap the GST.\n\nGray, known for conservative suits and cautious answers, served as Chr\u00e9tien\u2019s point man on many issues, including the APEC controversy and the Shawinigate affair, deflecting opposition questions about a hotel loan in Chr\u00e9tien\u2019s constituency.\n\nIn his riding, he was affectionately known as \u201cthe godfather of politics,\u201d and a coalition of Windsor non-profit groups named a building after him.\n\nWhen he stepped in as interim Opposition leader in 1990, he was often backed by a chorus of Liberal caucus members chanting \u201cHerb, Herb, Herb.\u201d\n\nPassionate about politics, he was also known for his love of political satire, and regularly tuned in to CBC\u2019s Radio\u2019s Royal Canadian Air Farce and Double Exposure .\n\n\u201cThe two of us have had to practically pull over because of our fits of laughter, especially when they do their imitations of him,\u201d he said.\n\nGray would often deliver one-liners during meetings that would go over other officials\u2019 heads, aides said.",

                "text": "Astronomers using ESA\u2019s XMM-Newton X-ray observatory have discovered, for the first time, a pair of supermassive black holes in orbit around one another in an ordinary galaxy.\n\nMost massive galaxies in the Universe are thought to harbor at least one supermassive black hole at their center.\n\nTwo supermassive black holes are the smoking gun that the galaxy has merged with another. Thus, finding binary supermassive black holes can tell astronomers about how galaxies evolved into their present-day shapes and sizes.\n\nTo date, only a few candidates for close binary supermassive black holes have been found. All are in active galaxies where they are constantly ripping gas clouds apart, in the prelude to crushing them out of existence. In the process of destruction, the gas is heated so much that it shines at many wavelengths, including X-rays. This gives the galaxy an unusually bright centre, and leads to it being called active.\n\nOn 10 June 2010, Dr Fukun Liu from Peking University in China with colleagues spotted a tidal disruption event in the galaxy SDSS J120136.02+300305.5 (J120136 for short). They were scanning the data for such events and scheduled follow-up observations just days later with XMM-Newton and NASA\u2019s Swift satellite.\n\nThe galaxy was still spilling X-rays into space. It looked exactly like a tidal disruption event caused by a supermassive black hole but as they tracked the slowly fading emission day after day something strange happened. The X-rays fell below detectable levels between days 27 and 48 after the discovery. Then they re-appeared and continued to follow a more expected fading rate, as if nothing had happened.\n\n\u201cThis is exactly what you would expect from a pair of supermassive black holes orbiting one another,\u201d said Dr Liu, who is the lead author of the study published in the Astrophysical Journal (arXiv.org version).\n\nDr Liu found that two possible configurations were possible to reproduce the observations of J120136.\n\nIn the first, the primary black hole contained 10 million solar masses and was orbited by a black hole of about a million solar masses in an elliptical orbit.\n\nIn the second solution, the primary black hole was about a million solar masses and in a circular orbit.\n\nIn both cases, the separation between the black holes was relatively small \u2013 about 2 thousandths of a light year. This is about the width of our Solar System.\n\nBeing this close, the fate of this newly discovered black hole pair is sealed. They will radiate their orbital energy away, gradually spiraling together, until in about two million years time they will merge into a single black hole.\n\nNow that astronomers have found this first candidate for a binary black hole in a quiescent galaxy, the search is inevitably on for more. This detection will also spur interest in a network of telescopes that search the whole sky for tidal disruption events.\n\n\u201cOnce we have detected thousands of tidal disruption events, we can begin to extract reliable statistics about the rate at which galaxies merge,\u201d said study co-author Dr Stefanie Komossa of the Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Radioastronomie in Bonn, Germany.\n\nF.K.

For European astronomers, it's happening to be looking at the right portion of sky at the exact moment a star is ripped apart by a giant black hole.\n\nThe auspicious discovery was made by the European Space Agency's orbiting X-ray observatory XMM-Newton. The cosmological providence revealed not one black hole, but two -- the first pair of supermassive black holes observed in a normal galaxy. Normal galaxies, or quiescent galaxies -- as opposed to active galaxies -- are no longer actively producing stars.\n\nBlack holes are much easier to locate in newer active galaxies. Finding them in normal galaxies -- as mentioned -- requires luck. While black holes in active galaxies are constantly eating up gas clouds and star matter, giving off detectable X-rays as a result, similar activity is less frequent and more sporadic in normal galaxies.\n\nCurrently, the only way to find a normal black hole is by happening upon a \"tidal disruption event,\" like the star consumption witnessed by ESA's XXM-Newton.\n\nWhat makes the latest discovery even more unusual is that the two black holes were found together, orbiting each other -- the product of two galaxies having merged.\n\nScientists hope this just the first of many similar discoveries to come.\n\n\"There might be a whole population of quiescent galaxies that host binary black holes in their centers,\" explained astronomer Stefanie Komossa, of the Max Planck Society in Germany.\n\nWith further analysis of binary black holes, scientists hope to learn how and at what rate galaxies merge with each other. \"Once we have detected thousands of tidal disruption events, we can begin to extract reliable statistics about the rate at which galaxies merge,\" Komossa said.\n\nEventually, these two newly discovered black holes will merge, and the result will be a massive burst of energy. The final merger will be the strongest source of gravitational waves the universe has ever seen.\n\nDetails of the new binary supermassive black holes will be published next month in The Astrophysical Journal.",

The city of Rome has inaugurated a revamped statue of Pope John Paul II after the first one was pilloried by the public and the Vatican. Artist Oliviero Rainaldi says he's pleased with the final product, saying it matches his original vision. He blamed foundry workers for a botched assemblage the first time around. When the statue was first unveiled in front of Rome's main train station in May 2011, it was widely criticized by passers-by as looking more like Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini than the beloved Polish pope. Even the Vatican's own art critic wrote that it looked like a \"bomb\" had landed.

                "text": "The Government is to fund a \u00a3200 million research ship to boost Cambridge-led polar study, Chancellor George Osborne has announced.\n\nAhead of a speech to leading scientists today, the Chancellor said a new polar research ship for the Madingley Road-based British Antarctic Survey would put the UK at the forefront of research in the Antarctic and Arctic oceans.\n\nThe new vessel will go towards replacing the UK\u2019s two current polar exploration ships, which are nearing the end of their lives.\n\nThe ship will have on board laboratories and carry cutting edge technology including robotic submarines and \u201cunderwater gliders\u201d to gather data on marine biology and ocean conditions.\n\nMr Osborne said: \u201cOne of the final frontiers in the world where there is still much discovery to be done are the polar oceans. Britain must continue to have a presence in these parts of the world.\n\n\u201cBut our two current polar exploration ships are nearing the end of their life and need replacing. So I am delighted that we are investing in a new polar research ship to carry cutting edge British technology to put British scientists at the forefront of research in both the Antarctic and the Arctic oceans.\u201d\n\nThe ship will be able to carry out longer voyages than the current vessels.\n\nIt is hoped that the use of robotic technology will help pave the way for the development of new industries.\n\nMinister for the polar regions Mark Simmonds said: \u201cA new state-of-the-art polar research flagship will extend the UK\u2019s capability and reach in polar waters. It also makes explicitly clear our long-term commitment to maintaining our presence and scientific excellence in South Georgia & the South Sandwich Islands and the British Antarctic Territory.\u201d\n\nAt his speech, the Chancellor will also launch a consultation with the scientific community to inform the Government\u2019s allocation of the \u00a37 billion investment budget for large capital projects in science and research announced last year.\n\nThe consultation is designed to ensure that the money is targeted at areas scientists believe will bring the greatest opportunities for applications in business in an effort to rebalance Britain\u2019s economy.\n\nMr Osborne said: \u201cWhile as a country we have a proud record in scientific ingenuity, too often it has been other countries that have enjoyed the economic opportunity from it.\n\n\u201cOur long term economic plan is about ensuring Britain benefits from its scientific excellence.\n\n\u201cThat is why we are taking the difficult decision to protect the science budget over the next Parliament. We are committing \u00a37 billion - no other government has made such a long term commitment.\n\n\u201cToday I will be announcing our plan for deciding where it will be allocated, beginning a consultation with both the scientific community - both researchers and businesses - to determine how it should be best invested. This is part of my personal priority to ensure Britain out-competes, out-smarts and out-does the rest of the world in scientific innovation and invention.\n\n\u201cBacking British science, supporting businesses seeking to grow off the back of it and protecting investment in it is a central part of our long term economic plan.\n\n\u201cBritain has a proud past leading the world in pushing the boundary of scientific discovery. I want it to be a mark of our future success.\u201d\n\nScience Minister David Willetts said: \u201cToday\u2019s launch of our consultation on future capital investment is a historic opportunity for British science. The next five years will see the largest ever sustained capital spend on science investment. Our scientists can identify the next Crick Institute or the next equivalent of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology for us to invest in.\u201d",

                "text": "UK science is to get one of the biggest, most capable polar research vessels in the world.\n\nThe \u00a3200m investment in an icebreaker was announced by Chancellor George Osborne in a speech in Cambridge.\n\nThe ship is likely to be 130m long and sport a helipad, cranes, onboard labs, and have the ability to deploy subs and other ocean survey and sampling gear.\n\nIt should be ready to enter service in 2019, and will support scientists in both the Antarctic and the Arctic.\n\nThe strength of its hull will allow it to push deeper into pack ice than any previous British research vessel.\n\nContinue reading the main story George Osborne has committed an inflation-linked \u00a31.1bn per year to be spent on science infrastructure through to 2020-21. A consultation with the science community will now determine where that money will go. The chancellor listed some disciplines that could benefit - from the search for dark matter to fusion energy, from phenomics to robotics. But it wasn't for government to choose, he said: \"It's over to you. The government is committing a historic \u00a37bn to science investment. We're asking you, the science community, and the business community too, how best to invest that funding, how to maintain excellence and where are the new opportunities that will put Britain ahead in the global race?\" The consultation will report back in the autumn.\n\nInitial technical specifications require the ship to be able to maintain a speed of three knots while breaking through 2m-thick floes.\n\nThe money to build and equip the vessel is coming from the government's capital investment fund for science, for which Mr Osborne has committed over \u00a37bn between now and 2020-21.\n\nAddressing an audience at the world-famous Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, the chancellor said science was at the core of rebalancing the UK economy: \"I get that this is something that Britain is brilliant at, and that it's vitally important to our economic future. So I've made it my personal priority in government to support [scientists in their] endeavour.\"\n\nMr Osborne added that there would now be a consultation on how best to spend the \u00a37bn science infrastructure monies.\n\nThe UK already operates two polar ships - the Royal Research Ship (RRS) James Clark Ross and the RRS Ernest Shackleton.\n\nThe former was built in 1990 and the latter in 1995.\n\nA case was made to government, and accepted, that this fleet needed to be augmented with a more modern capability if the nation's science at high latitudes was to remain competitive.\n\nAn early design concept for the new ship has been drawn up by naval architects, but this will need to be finessed.\n\nA clear imperative is that the final design features a helideck - something omitted on the Clark Ross and which experts have told the BBC is really essential for effective Antarctic operations.\n\nPrecisely where the ship will be built is an open question.\n\nGiven the scale of the investment, a home shipyard would obviously be preferred. But European Union rules will require that bids also be invited from beyond the UK.\n\nThere is sure to be some concern that the announcement of the new vessel will signal an imminent reduction in the fleet - one super ship to replace two ageing vessels.\n\nBut the Natural Environment Research Council (Nerc), which funds polar science in the UK, says this is not the current plan.\n\nThe desire is to operate both the Clark Ross and the Shackleton until at least the end of the decade, it states.\n\nA decision will then be taken on what to do with the Shackleton, which, unlike the Clark Ross, is not British-owned but leased from a Norwegian company.\n\nThe first of five available one-year extensions to this bareboat charter arrangement comes into effect in August.\n\nContinue reading the main story Global warming does not mean an end to polar ice nor to the need for icebreakers. Even if the Arctic becomes largely ice-free in summertime later this century, as the latest science suggests, the legacy of each winter's deep freeze will still litter the ocean - some of the jagged shards of ice will be visible but many will bob treacherously just below the surface. While reporting on an expedition through Canada's fabled Northwest Passage in October 2007, I woke to the sound of an unnerving clanging along the hull. The vessel, the Amundsen, was pushing through pack ice and each jolt and reverberation made me wonder about the strength of the steel. But to understand how the polar regions are changing, and the implications for everything from wildlife to fishing to new oilfields to future shipping routes, the view from space offered by satellites is not enough. For decades to come, the most detailed research will require tough vessels to venture into the midst of what has become a messy and hazardous scene.\n\nNerc has made it clear also that the capital investment for the new ship will not impact the budget for its day-to-day science or ongoing infrastructure needs. The investment is on a separate government line.\n\nThe council has recently upgraded its \"bluewater fleet\" - the open-ocean vessels RRS Discovery and RRS James Cook are both less than 10 years old.\n\nProf Duncan Wingham, the chief executive of Nerc, told BBC News: \"The new vessel will make Nerc's entire fleet, ton for ton, the most advanced scientific fleet in the world.\n\n\"The new ship will be a clear statement of the UK's commitment to science in the Antarctic and South Atlantic, and increases our ice-breaking capability in the south and, just as important, in the Arctic.\"\n\nSir Paul Nurse, the president of the Royal Society, welcomed the \"fantastic\" investment in polar science, and said it showed the chancellor \"really does get it\".\n\n\"Of course, we're still not the biggest spenders on science; we still look at the US, at Germany and South Korea, who are all investing more,\" he added.\n\n\"I'm hoping we'll be able to persuade the chancellor, not only to maintain where he is but also to increase the investment so we can really compete with those countries.\"\n\nWhat the new polar ship promises to be like\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",

                "text": "Donald Sterling, the longtime owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, was barred from the National Basketball Association (NBA) for life and fined $US2.5 million ($A2.7 million) by the league's commissioner, Adam Silver, on Tuesday for making racist remarks.\n\nSilver said that Sterling would be barred from any contact with his team and the league and that he would urge the league\u2019s board of governors to force Sterling to sell the team.\n\nThe fine, Silver said, was the maximum allowed by the league\u2019s constitution.\n\n\u201cThe views expressed by Mr Sterling are deeply offensive and harmful,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWe stand together in condemning Mr Sterling\u2019s views. They simply have no place in the NBA.\u201d\n\nSilver said Sterling, in an interview, had admitted to him that the racist remarks on a recording released last week by the website TMZ were his.\n\nSilver said he would \u201cdo everything in my power\u201d to see that Sterling was forced to sell the Clippers. \u201cI fully expect to get the support I need to remove him,\u201d Silver said.\n\nBefore the announcement, Silver said, he discussed the decision with Coach Doc Rivers and guard Chris Paul of the Clippers. \u201cI believe the players will be satisfied with the decision,\u201d Silver said.\n\nSilver\u2019s announcement came at the conclusion of the league\u2019s investigation, which started over the weekend after the recording was released and news of it spread. The ensuing outrage put tremendous pressure on Silver to act decisively. Owners, players and advertisers had passed judgment, with players staging on-court protests and advertisers suspending or cutting ties with the team.\n\nMark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, said on Monday, however, that the league had to tread carefully on owners\u2019 rights.\n\n\u201cWhat Donald said was wrong,\u201d Cuban said. \u201cIt was abhorrent. There\u2019s no place for racism in the NBA, any business I\u2019m associated with, and I don\u2019t want to be associated with people who have that position. But at the same time that\u2019s a decision I make. I think you\u2019ve got to be very, very careful when you start making blanket statements about what people say and think, as opposed to what they do. It\u2019s a very, very slippery slope.\u201d\n\nPlayers continued to stage protests against Sterling, with the Miami Heat mimicking the Clippers\u2019 Sunday protest before their playoff game on Monday night by tossing their warm-up gear in the middle of the court and practicing with their shirts inside out. The San Antonio Spurs and the Portland Trail Blazers wore black socks. Golden State Warriors Coach Mark Jackson called for fans to boycott Tuesday\u2019s Game 5 between the Clippers and the Warriors.\n\nMayor Kevin Johnson of Sacramento, a former NBA star, called for the league to issue the maximum possible penalty against Sterling.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a defining moment in the history of the National Basketball Association,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe recording of Sterling\u2019s remarks was believed to be recorded by a woman identified as V. Stiviano, who has regularly been seen with him. He seemed to tell her not to associate with black people and not to bring black people to Clippers games.\n\nThe remarks were roundly criticised and have caused an uproar in the league. A man's voice, now identified as Sterling\u2019s, criticised the woman for posing for photographs with black men, including the Hall of Fame basketball player Magic Johnson.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t put him on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me,\u201d the male voice said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t bring him to my games. Yeah, it bothers me a lot that you want to promo, broadcast that you\u2019re associating with black people. Do you have to?\u201d\n\nThe firestorm immediately followed. President Obama condemned the statements while on a trip to Malaysia. Advertisers suspended or cut ties to the team.\n\nMichael Jordan, a Hall of Fame player and an owner of the Charlotte Bobcats, said in a statement, \u201cThere is no room in the NBA \u2014 or anywhere else \u2014 for this kind of racism and hatred.\u201d\n\nSterling\u2019s time as owner of the Clippers has been marked by player unrest, accusations of racism and sexism, and until the team began winning consistently three years ago, incompetent basketball management.\n\nIn his primary business, real estate, he was sued by the Justice Department in 2009 for driving minority families out of the apartment buildings he owned or refusing to rent to them. He paid a $US2.725 million ($A2.94 million) settlement.\n\nHe was sued by his former general manager, Elgin Baylor, for age and race discrimination in 2009. In the suit, Baylor said that Sterling had a \u201cpervasive and ongoing racist attitude\u201d in negotiations with players and that his management was \u201ca Southern plantation-type structure.\u201d\n\nBaylor also quoted Sterling as saying, in contract negotiations with Danny Manning, \u201cI\u2019m offering you a lot of money for a poor black kid.\u201d\n\nMike Dunleavy also sued the team in 2010 for refusing to pay the balance of his contract after he was fired as coach and general manager. An arbitrator awarded him $US13 million ($A14.03 million).\n\nSterling\u2019s wife, Rochelle, recently sued Stiviano, seeking to recover $US1.8 million ($A1.94 million) in cash, property and cars.\n\nThe suits, combined with the Clippers\u2019 long history of losing, had made Sterling and his team a punch line for most of his time as owner.\n\nThat tenure began in 1981 when he bought the San Diego Clippers at the encouragement of Jerry Buss, the Lakers\u2019 owner at the time.\n\nSterling had lent financial help, buying some apartment buildings from Buss, when Buss needed money to buy the Los Angeles Lakers and the Forum in 1979. But by 1984 Sterling had made a spectacle of himself by moving his franchise to Los Angeles without league approval.\n\nFor that, David Stern, then the NBA commissioner, fined him $25 million ($A26.98 million). Sterling sued the league for $US100 million ($A107.93 million), prompting Stern to reduce the fine to $6 million ($A6.48 million).",

                "text": "(CNN) -- The NBA's commissioner came down hard Tuesday on Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, ordering him out of his team's business and pushing to force him to sell over racist remarks that caused a firestorm since becoming public days ago.\n\nAdam Silver detailed Sterling's punishment of a lifetime ban and $2.5 million fine -- the \"maximum amount\" allowed per league guidelines -- at a press conference eight hours before Sterling's Clippers were to tip off in the fifth game of a tightly contested first-round playoff series with the Golden State Warriors.\n\nSilver's decision was met with immediate support from NBA owners, players and others connected to the league who have been calling for swift, firm punishment ever since TMZ posted audio featuring the incendiary comments.\n\n\"I hope that every bigot in this country sees what happened to Mr. Sterling and recognizes that if he can fall, so can you,\" Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson, a former NBA All-Star who was tasked with leading the NBA players union's efforts on this matter.\n\nUnder the lifetime ban, Sterling is prohibited from attending NBA games or practices, stepping foot inside any Clippers' facility, taking part in business or personnel decisions, or having a role in league activities such as attending NBA Board of Governors meetings.\n\nSilver -- who succeeded longtime NBA leader David Stern in February -- also insisted he will do \"everything in my power\" to compel the NBA Board of Governors to \"force a sale\" of the Clippers. The commissioner said \"I fully expect\" to get the needed three-quarters of the league's owners -- meaning at least 23 -- to back the move, though Sterling could fight any such move in court.\n\nIf Sterling does sell the team, he stands to profit considerably: He bought the Clippers for $12 million in 1981, and the team is now worth $575 million, according to Forbes magazine. And he'd likely have plenty of suitors: Among them is Hollywood mogul David Geffen, who spokeswoman Priscila Giraldo says is \"interested\" in buying the team.\n\nRather than water cooler discussions of exciting NBA playoff action, people are talking about racist remarks by a team owner, said Gabe Feldman, head of Tulane University's sports law program.\n\nEstimating the team may be worth closer to $1 billion, Feldman added, \"He may get a lot of money from the sale, but I think it will allow the NBA to shift their focus.\"\n\nThat's what Clippers coach Doc Rivers said Tuesday night, commending Silver as \"fantastic\" for making \"a decision that really was the right one.\" While the players aren't rejoicing, they are breathing easier knowing what happened earlier in the day, he said.\n\n\"They were just happy that it was a resolution,\" Rivers said, expressing hope that playing the game will be a \"safe haven\" for all involved. \"... We're all in a better place because of this.\"\n\nThe inflammatory sentiments Silver referred to came packaged in a 10-minute recording that TMZ said occurred during an April 9 conversation between Sterling and girlfriend V. Stiviano.\n\nOn the recording, a man and woman argue about photos posted to Instagram in which she appears with African-Americans. The man says he doesn't want the woman bringing any black people to games with her.\n\nThe sports website Deadspin on Sunday posted five additional minutes of what it said was part of the same audio recording.\n\nNeither website has said how it obtained the recordings; Stiviano's lawyer's office said Sunday that she didn't release them to TMZ, while stating they are legitimate.\n\nOn Saturday, Clippers President Andy Roeser suggested the audio was aimed at \"getting even\" with Sterling over a lawsuit.\n\nRochelle Sterling filed a lawsuit last month against Stiviano, who she said was having an affair with her husband and accusing Stiviano of going after extremely wealthy older men.\n\nRoeser said that the offensive comments are \"not consistent with, nor does it reflect (Sterling's) views, beliefs or feelings.\" Moreover, he cast doubt as to whether Sterling had made them, stating: \"We do not know if it is legitimate or it has been altered.\"\n\nSilver expressed no such doubts Tuesday, saying the Clippers owner \"acknowledged it was his voice on the tape.\" Asked whether the owner expressed any remorse, the commissioner said, \"Mr. Sterling has not expressed those views directly to me.\"\n\nMoments after Silver's press conference concluded, the Clippers struck a different tone.\n\n\"We wholeheartedly support and embrace the decision by the NBA and Commissioner Adam Silver today,\" the team said. \"Now the healing process begins.\"\n\nThere is no question that Sterling rightfully owns the Clippers. Some observers question how comments, made privately, could serve as grounds for such punishment, including possibly forcing him to sell the team.\n\nYet while there's no precedent in the NBA, there is in other sports. In the 1990s, Major League Baseball repeatedly suspended Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott over racist and other controversial comments, and she ultimately sold the franchise.\n\nSilver said Tuesday he'd \"let the lawyers\" address specifics, while stating flatly, \"We have the authority to act as I've recommended.\"\n\nFeldman said some owners might be wary of setting a precedent in which anyone can be voted out \"just based on something they don't like, whether it was said privately or just said publicly.\" That view notwithstanding, NBA owners universally backed Silver's judgment in statements Tuesday.\n\nIf the owners follow through on the commissioner's recommendation to force him to sell, Sterling could fight back in the courts. But should he file a lawsuit, CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin says his chances of success seem \"basically zero.\"\n\nSterling so far hasn't had found support in the court of public opinion, especially among past and present players.\n\nMembers of his own team, the Clippers, debated boycotting their playoff game Saturday with the Warriors, according to coach Rivers. They decided against it, instead opting to stage a silent protest by removing their warmup shirts bearing team logos to reveal red T-shirts worn inside out, with the logos hidden.\n\nSilver said he talked to Rivers, Clippers star point guard Chris Paul (who is also the players union president) and other players prior to reaching his decision Tuesday morning.\n\nDollars talked, too, to ramp up the pressure for Silver to act.\n\nOver a dozen companies -- including State Farm, Virgin America, CarMax and Red Bull -- halted their sponsorships with the Clippers over the remarks, CNN Money reported.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday, the commissioner said he shares these companies \"outrage,\" adding \"it will take some time\" to get things right.\n\n\"I can understand how upset they are, and I'll do my best to bring them back into the NBA family,\" Silver said.\n\nFor some, his decision to ban Sterling was enough. Both Adidas and Samsung announced later Tuesday that they had renewed their \"partnerships\" in the wake of the owner's public punishment.\n\nWarriors coach Mark Jackson, who a day earlier urged fans to boycott Tuesday's game and said there was \"a real discussion among the players\" to do the same so long as Sterling remained in charge, thinks Silver gave everyone enough reason now to come out to a game.\n\n\"I thought he was absolutely incredible ... with the way that he took control of the moment,\" Jackson said of the commissioner before his team's playoff showdown in Los Angeles. \"... It was exactly what the doctor ordered.\"\n\nFive key players in the Donald Sterling uproar\n\nMagic Johnson: Players are 'very happy and satisfied'\n\nOne man thrust into the controversy -- seemingly out of the blue -- was NBA great Magic Johnson. In the TMZ recording, the man seems mad about a photo the woman posted to Instagram with Johnson.\n\n\"In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,\" the man says.\n\n\"If it's white people, it's OK?\" she responds. \"If it was Larry Bird, would it make a difference?\"\n\nBird was Johnson's chief rival when Bird's Boston Celtics and Johnson's Los Angeles Lakers ruled the NBA.\n\n\"I've known (Magic Johnson) well, and he should be admired. ... I'm just saying that it's too bad you can't admire him privately,\" the man on the recording says. \"Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me. And don't bring him to my games.\"\n\nAfter the audio went public, Johnson -- who, since retiring from basketball, has become a successful businessman and part owner of baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers -- expressed dismay and insisted he'd never attend a Clippers game so long as Sterling was the owner.\n\nJohnson offered a very different tune Tuesday, commending Silver for exhibiting \"great leadership\" in saying he and others \"are very happy and satisfied.\"\n\n\"I wish I was in LA, I would be at the Clipper game tonight!\" he tweeted.\n\nSterling has history of fighting discrimination claims in court\n\nWill the NBA make Sterling the first owner to give up team?\n\nCNN's Jill Martin, Corinna Lamb, Katie Lobosco, Steve Almasy, Paul Vercammen, Caleb Silver, Stephanie Elam, Ralph Ellis, AnneClaire Stapleton, Joe Sutton, Wayne Sterling and Kevin Dotson contributed to this report.",

                "text": "NBA commissioner Adam Silver delivered the swiftest, strongest penalty he could, then called on NBA owners to force Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling to sell the team for making racist comments that hurt the league.\n\nAlmost unanimously, owners supported the commissioner Tuesday as he handed down one of the harshest penalties in the history of U.S. sports.\n\n\"We stand together in condemning Mr. Sterling's views. They simply have no place in the NBA,\" Silver said at a media conference.\n\nSterling, 80, is banned for life from any association with the league or the Clippers and was fined $2.5 million \u2014 the maximum allowable under the NBA constitution. If three-fourths of the other 29 owners agree to Silver's recommendation, Sterling will be forced to sell the team he has owned since 1981.\n\n\"I fully expect to get the support I need from the other NBA owners to remove him,\" Silver said of Sterling.\n\nSeveral owners immediately chimed in with support of Silver's decision. Silver said a league investigation found that Sterling was in fact the person on the audiotapes that were released over the weekend and immediately sent shock waves throughout the game.\n\nSterling acknowledged he was the man on the tape, Silver said.\n\nA message left seeking comment at Sterling's business office hadn't been returned Tuesday afternoon. Team spokesman Seth Burton said in an email that the Clippers had no plans to issue a statement from Sterling on Tuesday.\n\nIt's unclear how Sterling will respond.\n\nPlayers and others cheered Silver's quick action, with union officials saying that if the league's punishment hadn't included a mandate for Sterling to sell the team, players were considering boycotting playoff games, including Tuesday's Golden State Warriors-Clippers matchup, the team's first home game since the scandal erupted.\n\n\"We wanted to be a part of this decision and we wanted Adam Silver to know where we stood. And we were very clear that anything other than Sterling selling his team was not going to be enough for us,\" said Roger Mason Jr., the first vice president of the players' union.\n\nChris Paul, the Clippers' all-star point guard and president of the players' union, issued a brief statement before leading Los Angeles against the Warriors in Game 5 of their tied playoff series.\n\n\"In response to today's ruling by the NBA and commissioner Adam Silver, my teammates and I are in agreement with his decision,\" Paul said. \"We appreciate the strong leadership from commissioner Silver and he has our full support.\"\n\n\"This league is far bigger than any one owner, any one coach and any one player,\" said Silver, who as commissioner has broad powers under what's typically called the \"best interest of the game\" clause of the NBA constitution.\n\nBut Silver works for the owners and he will need 75 per cent of them \u2014 if all 30 teams vote, he'll need 23 on his side \u2014 to force Sterling out of the league completely.\n\nThe fine will be donated to organizations dedicated to anti-discrimination and tolerance efforts that will be jointly selected by the NBA and the Players Association, Silver said.\n\n\"This has all happened in three days, and so I am hopeful there will be no long-term damage to the league and to the Clippers organization,\" Silver said. \"But as I said earlier, I'm outraged so I certainly understand other people's outrage. This will take some time and appropriate healing will be necessary.\"\n\nAfter the announcement, the Clippers' website had a simple message: \"We are one,\" it read.\n\n\"We wholeheartedly support and embrace the decision by the NBA and commissioner Adam Silver today. Now the healing process begins,\" the Clippers added in a statement.\n\nThe \"We are one\" mantra was repeated by the team's public-address announcers and chanted by their fans several times during their playoff game Tuesday night, a cathartic 113-103 victory over the Golden State Warriors.\n\nThe Clippers received raucous cheers when they took the court for warmups before Game 5. Two days earlier, they dumped their team warmup jerseys in a pile at centre court in Oakland in a gesture of defiance against their owner before losing Game 4 of the series.\n\nSterling's Clippers have been one of the most incompetent franchises in pro sports and nearly all of their previous seasons would have been finished by now. But after the most successful two-year stretch in Clippers history, the current team is a title contender led by Doc Rivers, a black head coach whom Sterling brought in from Boston and paid $7 million a year.\n\n\"[Silver] made the decision that really was the right one that had to be made,\" Rivers said before the Clippers' game. \"I don't think this is something that we rejoice in or anything like that. I told the players about the decision and I think they were just happy there was a resolution and that it's over, at least the start of it. I think we're all in a better place because of this.\"\n\nSterling's comments were released over the weekend by TMZ and Deadspin and numerous NBA owners and players have condemned them. Even President Barack Obama weighed in on the crisis, the first of Silver's brief tenure as commissioner.\n\n\"Commissioner Silver thank you for protecting our beautiful and powerful league!! Great leader!!,\" Miami Heat star LeBron James wrote on Twitter.\n\nLakers guard and Canadian Steve Nash, spoke as a representative of current NBA players at a press conference assembled by Sacramento mayor and National Basketball Players Association adviser Kevin Johnson, along with Los Angeles major Eric Garcetti.\n\nNash, from Victoria, thanked Silver for \"a quick, unequivocal and concise decision made today on behalf of everyone involved in this situation.\n\n\"It begs the bigger question: if racism is a learned behaviour, how long will it go on for?\" Nash continued. \"How long will people be taught to be bigoted, to discriminate and to instill hatred in our communities?\n\n\"Let's hope this is an opportunity for all of us ... to help educate and take one step further to eradicating racism in our communities.\"\n\nMaple Leafs Sports and Entertainment, which owns the Toronto Raptors, also released a statement in support of Silver's decision.\n\n\"As a proud member of the National Basketball Association, we stand strongly in our belief that the comments attributed to Mr. Sterling have no place in our society or sport, the statement read.\n\n\"Our organization will always work to contribute to a culture of diversity and acceptance in this league and fully support the actions taken today. We thank Commissioner Adam Silver, and all of the NBA players, for their leadership on this important issue.\"\n\nThe league's investigation started Saturday and players immediately began expressing intense displeasure with the situation, even going so far as to ask Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson to get involved on behalf of the players' union.\n\n\"When one rotten apple does something, or if you see cancer, you've got to cut it out really quickly,\" Kevin Johnson said at a news conference in Los Angeles, flanked by NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and players like Steve Nash, Tyson Chandler, Luke Walton and Roger Mason Jr., among others. \"And Commissioner Silver did that in real time. We're so proud and thankful for him.\"\n\nThe sanctions came a few hours before the Clippers were to play Golden State in Game 5 of a tied-up Western Conference first-round playoff series.\n\n\"When you get this many Lakers to stand up for the Clippers, you know something big is happening in L.A.,\" Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said. \"We are a single team here today, a team not only speaking out for what we're against \u2014 racism, hatred, bigotry, intolerance \u2014 but what we're for. We're for great basketball.\"\n\nBefore Silver took the podium, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban tweeted out a photo of the NBA Constitution, saying \"It exists for a reason.\"\n\nSeveral sponsors either terminated or suspended their business dealings with the team on Monday, though individual deals that some of those companies have with Clippers stars like Chris Paul and Blake Griffin will continue and were not affected. Still, it was a clear statement that companies, like just about everyone inside the league, were outraged.\n\n\"Commissioner Silver showed great leadership in banning LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling for life,\" Magic Johnson, who was referenced on the taped conversation involving Sterling, tweeted shortly after the league's decision was announced.\n\nJohnson's role on the tape stemmed from Sterling's female companion apparently posting a photo of her and the Hall of Fame player on her Instagram account. That photo has since been deleted, but raised Sterling's ire nonetheless.\n\n\"It bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you're associating with black people. Do you have to?\" Sterling asks the woman on the tape.\n\nThe issues raised when the tapes were released over the weekend represent just another chapter in Sterling's long history of being at the centre of controversy.\n\nIn the past, he's faced extensive federal charges of civil rights violations and racial discrimination in his business dealings, and some of his race-related statements would be described as shocking.\n\nHe has also been sued in the past for sexual harassment by former employees, and even the woman who goes by the name \"V. Stiviano\" \u2014 purportedly the female voice on the tapes at the center of this scandal \u2014 describes Sterling in court documents as a man \"with a big toothy grin brandishing his sexual prowess in the faces of the Paparazzi and caring less what anyone else thought, the least of which, his own wife.\"\n\nStiviano is being sued by Rochelle Sterling, who is seeking to reclaim at least $1.8 million in cash and gifts that her husband allegedly provided the woman.\n\nStiviano is \"very saddened\" by his lifetime NBA ban and she didn't release the recording of their conversation, her lawyer said Tuesday.\n\nStiviano \"never wanted any harm to Donald,\" Siamak Nehoray of Calabasas told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nSomebody released it \"for money,\" but it wasn't Stiviano, the attorney said.\n\n\"My client is devastated that this got out,\" he said.\n\nNehoray previously said the recording posted online is a snippet of a conversation lasting roughly an hour.\n\nSilver said when he first heard the audio, he hoped it had been altered or was fake \u2014 but also said that from his 20-year relationship with Sterling, he suspected the voice was his.\n\n\"This has been a painful moment,\" Silver said, \"for all members of the NBA family.\"",

                "text": "Police stop and search powers in England and Wales are to be overhauled with a revised code of conduct, Home Secretary Theresa May has said.\n\nShe told MPs an inquiry had found 27% of searches may have been illegal.\n\nShe said that if the number of stop and searches did not now come down, she would seek to change the law.\n\nThe move follows a consultation, which highlighted concerns that stop and search was used too widely and was unfairly targeting ethnic minorities.\n\nLabour say the plans do not go far enough.\n\nRecent figures show only about 10% of more than a million searches lead to an arrest, with black people six times more likely to be stopped than those who are white.\n\nAt present, police can stop someone if they have reasonable grounds to suspect they are carrying illegal drugs, a weapon, stolen property or something which could be used to commit a crime, such as a crowbar.\n\nContinue reading the main story One of the most telling contributions in the Commons debate after Theresa May's announcement came from the black Labour MP Diane Abbott. Stop and search, she said, was the one issue that \"poisoned\" relationships between police and urban communities more than any other. Indeed, the high level of stops in London, particularly among young black men, was considered to be a factor which contributed to the riots in 2011. Since then, the Metropolitan Police has cut its use of stop and search and increased its arrest ratio - improvements highlighted by the home secretary to show that forces can make a difference without the government having to change the law. It's believed legislation was ruled out after objections from Downing Street, who feared it could be construed as being soft on crime.\n\nHowever, under Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act, officers can also stop and search someone without suspicion that they are involved in wrongdoing if approved by a senior officer, for example, because there is a fear that serious violence could take place.\n\nMrs May said when misused, stop and search was an \"enormous waste of police time\" and \"hugely damaging to the relationship between the police and the public\".\n\nShe referred to a recent inquiry by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC), which found that more than half of all forces in England and Wales were ignoring some rules on stop and search.\n\n\"It is very clear that in a large number of cases the reasonable grounds for suspicion were not there and one can only therefore assume, given that black people are six times more likely to be stopped and searched than a white person, that it is precisely the fact that they are a black person that has led to that stop and search taking place.\n\n\"It is absolutely disgraceful and sadly... this is a feeling that has come through to young people in black and minority ethnic communities that this is what happens and that this is, if you like, a way of life.\"\n\nUnder the new plans:\n\nThe BBC's home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the home secretary had wanted to go further, but her original proposals were blocked by Downing Street which was worried they might leave the Conservatives looking soft on crime in the run-up to the general election in 2015.\n\nResponding to Mrs May in the Commons, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper asked her: \"Why aren't you banning the use of targets given to police officers to stop and search a certain number of people?\n\n\"Why won't you put the guidance on race discrimination on a statutory basis?\n\n\"And why won't you insist that all forces abide by case law rather than some?\"\n\nShe added: \"Your plans have been frisked of serious substance and we need to know why you have backed down.\"\n\n\"Your advisers have blamed 'regressive attitudes in No 10'. But why have you listened to them?\"\n\nRachel Robinson, policy director at campaign group Liberty, said the proposals were \"a half-hearted mix of voluntary, patchy measures\", adding: \"Public trust is wearing thin and today was a missed chance for real change.\"\n\nLabour's Diane Abbott, who was Britain's first black woman MP, said successive governments had \"failed to act\" on the problem, so Mrs May deserved \"some credit... for having taken things as far as you have done\".\n\n\"There is no single issue that poisons relationships between urban communities and the police more than stop and search,\" she told the Commons.\n\nConservative Charles Walker gave an example of one of his constituents who had been stopped 50 times between the ages of 13 and 18, adding that he would have a sense of \"total desolation and alienation\" if that had happened to one of his children.\n\nMrs May said a consultation held last year in England and Wales into stop and search attracted more than 5,000 responses and found very different attitudes towards the practice.\n\nSeventy-eight per cent of those aged between 55 and 74 thought it was an effective tool, but just 38% of those between 18 and 24 agreed.\n\nOf white respondents, 66% believed it was effective, compared with 38% of black respondents.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said stop and search was increasingly being used in a more targeted and effective way, but it recognised there was \"much more to do to improve confidence across all communities in the use of the powers\".\n\nShauneen Lambe, executive director of campaign organisation Just for Kids Law, told the BBC: \"Obviously, we think it's great that it's finally been recognised that stop and search has been used discriminatorily and unnecessarily, but our concern is how well these plans will be implemented.\n\n\"I think that with an intent and an ethos things can change, but we do feel their need to be greater sanctions for misuse too.\"",

                "text": "The home secretary, Theresa May, is to introduce a \"comprehensive package\" reforming the use of police stop-and-search powers after telling MPs that as many as a quarter of a million street searches last year were probably carried out illegally.\n\nThe home secretary said she wanted the battery of revised codes, best practice schemes and new methods of accountability to lead to a significant reduction in the use of stop and search, more intelligence-led targeted operations, and better arrest ratios.\n\nBlack people are still seven times more likely to be stopped by the police than white people, with only about one in 10 of those stops leading to an arrest.\n\nBut during a Commons statement on Wednesday it became clear that May has lost her battle to persuade Downing Street that legislation to curb the use of stop and search should be included in this summer's Queen's speech \u2013 the annual legislative programme \u2013 the last before next year's general election.\n\n\"I want to make myself absolutely clear: if the numbers do not come down, if stop and search does not become more targeted, if those stop-to-arrest ratios do not improve considerably, the government will return with primary legislation to make those things happen,\" May told the Commons.\n\n\"Nobody wins when stop and search is misapplied. It is a waste of police time. It is unfair, especially to young, black men. It is bad for public confidence in the police,\" she told MPs.\n\nMay justified the need for a comprehensive reform package by citing the findings of a study by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary that showed 27% of stop-and-search records they looked at did not contain reasonable grounds to search people, even though they had been endorsed by supervising officers\n\n\"If the HMIC sample is accurate, that means more than a quarter of the million or so stops carried out under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act last year could have been illegal,\" May said.\n\nA Home Office consultation launched last July on the future of stop-and-search powers has generated more than 5,000 responses. They showed that young people and black people had very different attitudes towards stop and search than white and older age groups.\n\nThe package of reforms proposed by May now includes:\n\n\u2022 A revised code of practice making clear what constitutes \"reasonable grounds for suspicion\" under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, which covers the vast majority of stops carried out. Officers who fail to use their powers properly will face disciplinary proceedings.\n\n\u2022 Telling chief constables and police commissioners they must open up police stop-and-search records to public scrutiny, under threat of statutory legislation.\n\n\u2022 Review national police training to include \"unconscious bias awareness training\" to reduce possibility of prejudice in officers' approach to stop and search.\n\n\u2022 Official assessment of individual officer's fitness to use stop-and-search powers.\n\n\u2022 Launch a new \"best use of stop and search scheme\" which will include better recording and improved public accountability and will limit the use of section 60 \"no suspicion\" stop-and-search powers to 15 hours.\n\nMay launched the consultation last July saying she wanted to introduce proposals to scale back the use of police stop-and-search powers and ensure their \"fair and effective use\".\n\nAt the time, the home secretary said it was no longer sustainable that black people were still seven times more likely to be searched on the street than white people. She also said it had been seen as sharply divisive in Britain's black and minority ethnic communities.\n\nMay had planned to announce cabinet approval of her proposals before last Christmas, but she ran into strong Downing Street concerns that the move could leave the Tories looking \"soft on crime\".\n\nNick Clegg, who chairs the cabinet's home affairs committee, is said to have backed May's package but it was not sufficient to end the standoff.\n\nThe Metropolitan and West Midlands police forces have already massively scaled back their use of stop and search as part of a successful pilot scheme using a more \"intelligence-led approach\".\n\nIn the Met, the use of stop and search has fallen by 20% since 2012 and the use of section 60 \"no suspicion\" stops by 90% over the same period. At the same time stabbings have fallen by a third, shootings by 40%. The arrest ratio has gone up and complaints have gone down.",

The research was commissioned after LSE/Guardian research into the August 2011 riots identified the operation of the stop-and-search laws as a key factor behind the disturbances.\n\nMay told the Commons that as long as she was home secretary she would maintain the ability of the police to stop and search suspects, saying it was an important power in the fight against crime.\n\nBut she said the fact that only 9% of the 1.2 million stop-and-search incidents that took place every year led to an arrest \"prompts me to question whether stop and search is always used appropriately\".\n\nThe home secretary said the search-to-arrest ratio varied from 3% in Cumbria, to 7% the West Midlands, and 8% in Manchester and in London, where most stop-and-searches take place.\n\n\"We shouldn't expect all stop-and-search incidents to lead to arrest but those percentages are too low for comfort,\" she said.\n\nIn London this meant that 45,000 criminals had been arrested in the past 12 months, including 3,212 carrying weapons, and 7,287 in possession of suspected stolen goods.\n\nMay said that it took 16 minutes for an officer to conduct a stop and search and complete the paperwork. \"If it's being used too much or with the wrong people, then it is a dreadful waste of police time,\" she said.\n\nIn tThe Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, has set a target that at least 20% of searches in London should lead to an arrest or drugs warning. The latest figure suggests it had risen to 18.3% in the last year after the adoption of a more \"intelligence-led approach\" at a time when the overall use of the powers had fallen from 500,000 to 350,000.\n\n\"I want to see stop and search used only when it is needed. I want to see higher search-to-arrest ratios. I want to see better community engagement and I want to see more efficient recording practices across the country,\" said the home secretary.\n\nThe launch of the consultation was widely welcomed in the Commons. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, noted that searches under section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act\u2013 which do not even need the police to have any grounds of suspicion \u2013 black people were 25 times more likely to be searched in the street.\n\n\"It can't be right in Britain that you should be targeted because of the colour of your skin,\" he said.\n\nMay said that she would bring forward detailed proposals for change, short of setting targets, this year after the public consultation.",

That came after it chose not to run an item linking Jimmy Savile with child abuse.\n\nPaxman said it was \"time to move on\" and he \"should rather like to go to bed at much the same time as most people\".\n\nDirector General Tony Hall said Paxman, 63, was \"a rare and dazzling talent\".\n\n\"He has a unique ability to create moments of real discomfort for politicians and memorable delight for audiences,\" Mr Hall said.\n\n\"For that cussed brilliance and much more besides, the BBC and our audiences will always be in his debt.\"\n\nPaxman will continue to present University Challenge, which he has fronted since 1994.\n\nThe BBC's head of news, James Harding, said Paxman had become the \"great lion of BBC journalism\" who \"never failed to ask the difficult questions\".\n\nAssociate editor of the Daily Mirror Kevin Maguire tweeted: \"Jeremy Paxman quitting Newsnight is like the ravens flying the Tower of London or the Barbary apes leaving Gibraltar.\"\n\nAnd the Daily Telegraph's Dan Hodges wrote that the \"great lion sleeps tonight\", adding that \"the place people now go at 10.30pm to get their current affairs fix isn't the TV, but Twitter\".\n\nPaxman, who previously worked on programmes including Panorama and BBC's Breakfast Time, is best known for his confrontational interview style.\n\nAmong his most famous grillings was that of Michael Howard in 1997, when he asked the Conservative politician the same question 12 times.\n\nFormer home secretary Mr Howard had held a meeting with Derek Lewis, the head of Her Majesty's Prison Service about the possible dismissal of the head of Parkhurst Prison.\n\nMr Howard was asked repeatedly of Mr Lewis, \"Did you threaten to overrule him?\" - to which the MP repeatedly said he \"did not overrule him\", but ignored the \"threaten\" aspect of the question.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Paxman said: \"I have decided it is time to move on from Newsnight.\n\n\"After 25 years, I should rather like to go to bed at much the same time as most people.\n\n\"This was a decision I reached - and informed the BBC of - last July.

I think I've been lucky and wish the programme well.\"\n\nThe BBC said in a statement that despite deciding to leave last year, \"with the appointment of a new editor and following a difficult period for Newsnight, Jeremy generously agreed to stay to help the new team bed down\".\n\nThe programme was heavily criticised for not running a report which linked Jimmy Savile to allegations of child sex abuse, shortly before an ITV documentary made the allegations public.\n\nOfcom also upheld a complaint against an episode of Newsnight which led to Tory peer Lord McAlpine being wrongly implicated in child sex abuse allegations.\n\nNewsnight broadcast allegations against an unnamed \"leading Conservative politician from the Thatcher years\" - Lord McAlpine was not named, but was the subject of internet speculation.\n\nOfcom criticised programme makers for not contacting Lord McAlpine prior to the broadcast, when he would have been able to inform them he had never been to the children's home in question.\n\nPaxman started work for the BBC on Radio Brighton.\n\nHe then moved to Northern Ireland where he covered the Troubles for the BBC for three years.\n\nHe has also worked for BBC One's Tonight programme and the Six O'Clock News.",

                "text": "In his 25 years in the Newsnight hot seat, Jeremy Paxman has earned a reputation as one of the most fearless and feared interviewers in the game.\n\nHis status is such that the phrase to be \"paxoed\" has entered the media lexicon, meaning a journalistic \"going over\" to be avoided by hapless politicians.\n\nHowever, many of Westminster's toughest and wiliest operators have succumbed.\n\nThe journalist has been no respecter of standing or affiliation, giving an equally rough ride to interviewees, whether they were Conservative or Labour, prime ministers, masters of the universe or junior officials.\n\nSome hardened politicians reportedly refused to appear on the programme when he was presenting while others donned their tin hats and became regular sparring partners.\n\nPerhaps more than any other, Michael Howard's appearance on Newsnight in 1997 has entered broadcasting and political folklore.\n\nIn the middle of a Tory leadership contest, Mr Howard was asked about his relationship with the former head of the Prison Service, Derek Lewis, whom he had sacked in 1995 after a series of escapes by IRA prisoners.\n\nThe Newsnight host famously put the same question 12 times to the former home secretary without appearing to get a satisfactory answer.\n\nHe later played down what many immediately hailed as a moment of journalistic genius, suggesting that he could not think of anything else to ask him as the interview progressed.\n\nThe BBC had well-documented run-ins with the Labour government in the lead-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, with much probing about the relationship between Tony Blair and George Bush.\n\nIn a 2003 edition, Jeremy Paxman took a different tack and appeared to take the prime minister genuinely by surprise when he asked him whether he and the US president had prayed together.\n\nThe same question has been posed several times since then but it was Paxman who asked it first.\n\nLike Mr Blair, William Hague is regarded as one of the most talented media performers of his generation but that did not protect him when he was put on the spot in 2009 about Tory donor Lord Ashcroft's tax status.\n\nAs before, the Newsnight host deployed the tactic of asking the same question, or variations on the same question, on multiple occasions and the then shadow foreign secretary seemed taken aback by this.\n\nSome politicians have literally had their careers made or broken by their appearances on Newsnight.\n\nJunior Treasury minister and rising Conservative star Chloe Smith was dispatched to appear on the programme in 2012 to talk about a proposed delay to a rise in fuel duty.\n\nWhat followed was painful to watch as the minister struggled to appear on top of her brief and give the appearance that she was privy to what was going on in the upper echelons of her department.\n\nChancellor George Osborne was criticised for not going on the programme himself and allowing Ms Smith to take the fire.\n\nAlthough remaining magnanimous about the encounter, Ms Smith was moved to another job in a reshuffle that year and has since left the government.\n\nThe Newsnight host has not always had it his own way, of course, and some of his most memorable encounters have taken place when his subjects have fought back.\n\nMedia magnate Conrad Black famously chided Jeremy Paxman as a \"gullible, priggish, English fool\" when questioned about his (Black's) conviction for fraud and subsequent imprisonment.\n\nAnd many felt the legendary interviewer finally met his match when he came up against Russell Brand last year.\n\nHis joust with the comedian and provocateur, in which Russell Brand mused on the point of voting and the need for a popular revolution, became an instant hit on social media.\n\nThe Newsnight host took his interviewee to task for not being \"arsed\" to vote but had to admit afterwards that he had also failed to do so on one recent occasion.",

                "text": "It's Jeremy Paxman's last time in the Newsnight chair tonight and the BBC have put out this teaser of the interviewer and London Mayor Boris Johnson sharing a tandem. Ahead of his final show, we look back on Paxman's best moments:\n\nPaxman's most infamous political interview was with Michael Howard, then the home secretary, in May 1997. The presenter asks Howard the same question \u2013 \"Did you threaten to overrule him?\" \u2013 twelve times. A masterclass in persistence, even if it merely led to a very uncomfortable stalemate.\n\nAmid numerous U-turns prompted by his 'omnishambles' budget of 2012, the chancellor chose not to tour the television studios to defend his decision to delay a planned 3p rise in fuel duty. Instead, he sent his junior Treasury minister, 30-year-old Chloe Smith, to explain. Except she couldn't. \n\n\n\nHaving insisted several times, in a line of questioning that looked in danger of going down the Michael Howard route, Paxman sighed: \"You cant even tell me when you were told what the change of policy was. You were told some time today clearly, was it before lunch or after lunch?\"\n\nOne to watch behind your hands.\n\nThe presenter entertains the great sage of the 21st century, Russell Brand, about voting, revolution and beards. Paxman's solidarity with Brand over why young Britons are so apathetic about politics provoked something of a backlash, prompting Nick Clegg to accuse the presenter of 'sneering'. Opened a debate about the 'tawdriness' of the political system, and added much to the Great Beard Discussion of 2013.\n\nTwo top-drawer debaters lock horns in this 2012 interview that starts off testy. It then descends into outright scorn, Black bristling at Paxman repeatedly calling him a 'crook'.\n\n\n\nPaxman puts Tony Blair in an awkward position (8 minutes 50 seconds) by listing pornographic publications in the same stable as the Express Newspaper (whose owner Blair said was a suitable party donor).\n\nAnd even Paxman's colleagues aren't safe. Economics Editor Paul Mason has an uncomfortable interview from Athens.",

                "text": "Jeremy Paxman \u2013 famous for asking Michael Howard the same question a dozen times \u2013 has announced he is to quit his job as rottweiler-in-chief at Newsnight after 25 years.\n\nThe BBC said Paxman had informed them of his decision to step down last summer, but he had agreed to stay on for another year under the new editor, Ian Katz, who was brought in to stabilise the programme after the Jimmy Savile and Lord McAlpine crises.\n\nThe presenter, who is about to turn 64, will also continue in his role as presenter of University Challenge, but has not yet been lined up to take on a new job in BBC News. There was no comment from Paxman in the BBC statement announcing his departure, but the corporation said he would host his final Newsnight in June.\n\nLong thought to be the best-paid presenter in news, Paxman earned about \u00a3800,000 a year for his work on Newsnight and University Challenge.\n\nNewsnight ratings have dropped to 600,000 viewers a night from 800,000 in 2010. Paxman, though, has long been the programme's most popular presenter.\n\nDespite a career spanning more than four decades in the BBC, Paxman has been well known, for outspoken criticism of his employer. In October 2013, he said he had \"seriously considered\" quitting Newsnight after the Savile and McAlpine scandals dented the reputation of the programme.\n\nAnd a fortnight ago remarks made in an interview with the Guardian angered bosses at the BBC: \"There's a pile of stuff on the BBC I can't stand,\" he said in the interview. \"My idea of hell is going down in one of the lifts in that ghastly new building [New Broadcasting House] in a lift which has Radio 1Xtra plumbed into it. I don't quite understand why the BBC does Radio 1Xtra \u2026 The BBC has got an unfortunate history of never seeing an area of broadcasting, or increasingly a web presence, without feeling the need to get into it itself.\"\n\nThat prompted the Radio 1 boss, Ben Cooper, to ask him to \"consider\" the impact his opinions had on other parts of the BBC.\n\nSome of Paxman's more memorable moments as the presenter of Newsnight include his 1998 interview with Denis Halliday, a United Nations humanitarian coordinator who had resigned his post in Iraq. Questioning his motives, Paxman asked him: \"Aren't you just an apologist for Saddam Hussein?\"\n\nIt was a performance that he repeated in 2003 when interviewing Tony Blair about his decision to invade Iraq. Chairing a debate in front of a live audience, Paxman asked Blair if he and the US president, George Bush, prayed together. Blair answered: \"No, Jeremy. We do not pray together.\"\n\nPaxman came under fire for his interview with George Galloway in 2005 where, following Galloway's victory over Labour's Oona King, he asked: \"Mr Galloway, are you proud of having got rid of one of the very few black women in parliament?\" Last year, Downing Street demanded a full and public apology from Paxman after he called the prime minister a \"complete idiot\" over his plans for the first world war centenary.\n\nAs one of four presenters of the flagship BBC2 show, alongside Kirsty Wark, Emily Maitlis and the newly appointed Laura Kuenssberg, it is not clear who will replace him as the programme's lead anchor once he departs in June.\n\nHowever, now that Kuenssberg has been lured to the programme from ITV, the BBC may favour an ensemble approach as favoured by Radio 4's Today programme.\n\nAmong the names touted to join Newsnight are the presenter of the Radio 4 programme PM, Eddie Mair, who made waves with his interview with Boris Johnson in 2013 where he branded the London mayor \"a nasty piece of work\".\n\nThe bookmaker Paddy Power has already started taking bets on who will be his replacement, with Kuenssberg currently ahead at 4/5 and the new presenter of the Today programme, Mishal Husain, at 8/1.\n\nTony Hall, the director general of the BBC, said: \"This is a particularly poignant moment for me, because I have known Jeremy and relished working with him since the day I joined the BBC in 1973. And I am therefore better placed than most to know what a remarkable job he has done at Newsnight.\n\n\"His is a rare and dazzling talent. He has a unique ability to create moments of real discomfort for politicians and memorable delight for audiences. For that cussed brilliance and much more besides, the BBC and our audiences will always be in his debt.\"\n\nKatz added: \"I'm deeply grateful to him for delaying his departure to help renew the programme, and for the extraordinary support and generosity he has shown.\"\n\nIt is thought that Paxman is prepared to consider presenting some programmes for rival broadcasters, although his agent declined to comment.\n\nDespite the looming general election next year, there are no plans for Paxman to work on any other programmes at the BBC at the moment other than University Challenge \u2013 although the corporation said it would be open to working with him on more shows.",

                "text": "Gerry Adams, the Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in leader and chief architect of the Irish republican movement's peace strategy, has been arrested by police over a notorious Troubles murder that has haunted his political career for decades.\n\nThe veteran Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in president put himself forward for questioning by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) in connection with the kidnapping, killing and secret burial of Jean McConville.\n\nThe family of the widowed mother of 10, whom the IRA \"disappeared\" just before Christmas 1972, welcomed the arrest and said they hoped it would lead to the whole truth ultimately being exposed about their mother's murder.\n\nBut Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in's deputy leader, Mary Lou McDonald, who sits alongside Adams in the Irish parliament, described the arrest of her fellow TD (MP) as politically motivated after a \"concerted and malicious effort to link Gerry Adams to this case for considerable time\".\n\nA spokesman for the Northern Ireland Office rejected the suggestion that the arrest was politically motivated. The spokesman said: \"This is entirely an operational matter for the PSNI.\"\n\nA PSNI spokesman said: \"Detectives from the serious crime branch investigating the abduction and murder of Jean McConville in 1972 have arrested a 65-year-old man in Antrim. The suspect is currently being interviewed by detectives at the serious crime suite in Antrim police station.\"\n\nJust before Adams walked into the police station on Wednesday evening, he denied to RT\u00c3\u0089 television that he had anything to with the McConville murder. Adams also rejected recent claims by former IRA bomber and convicted killer Peter Rogers that he and the Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in deputy first minister Martin McGuinness had ordered him to transport explosives to bomb Britain in 1980.\n\nIn a statement issued shortly after it was announced that he had been arrested, Adams said: \"I believe that the killing of Jean McConville and the secret burial of her body was wrong and a grievous injustice to her and her family.\n\n\"Well-publicised, malicious allegations have been made against me. I reject these. While I have never disassociated myself from the IRA and I never will, I am innocent of any part in the abduction, killing or burial of Mrs McConville.\"\n\nThe arrest of Adams follows the decision of a US court to compel a US university to hand over a series of tape recorded interviews with former republican paramilitaries. The Boston College Belfast Project tapes, which also include frank testimonies from former loyalist paramilitaries, were only meant to have been made public once an individual who gave candid interviews about their role in political violence had died.\n\nIn an interview published posthumously, Adams's former comrade and close friend, the late Belfast IRA commander Brendan Hughes, alleged that the future Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in president gave the order for Jean McConville to be \"disappeared\" by a specialist IRA unit that the future Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in chief set up to weed out informers within the nationalist community in the city. Adams has denied not only being involved in the McConville murder but that he was ever a member of the IRA.\n\nThe arrest of Adams is an acutely sensitive matter \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a point highlighted by Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in, which suggested that the move was designed to damage the party on the eve of the European parliamentary elections. Alex Maskey, a veteran Adams ally who sits in the Northern Ireland assembly, told Newsnight on BBC2: \"Let's remember that Gerry Adams voluntarily made arrangements to speak to the PSNI and then he has been arrested in such a public fashion. We believe there is a political agenda here \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 We are now three weeks into an election and we believe there is a very negative agenda.\"\n\nThe government will say that all decisions on the Adams case are taken independently of ministers. Any decision to charge Adams would be taken by Barra McGrory QC, the director of public prosecutions in Northern Ireland, who has acted on behalf of Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in in the past and who has a reputation for being scrupulously fair.\n\nMcConville was torn away from her 10 children at their home in the Divis flats complex in west Belfast in December 1972. The IRA put out a bogus story that she had later run away to England and had abandoned her children. They also alleged that the 37-year-old Protestant-born widow was an informer, which the then Northern Ireland police ombudsman Nuala O'Loan later concluded was untrue.\n\nIt was not until 1999 that the IRA finally admitted they had abducted, killed and buried her on a beach in Co Louth, across the border in the Irish Republic.\n\nIvor Bell, another of Adams's one-time republican comrades who, like Hughes became a bitter critic of the Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in's president, is currently on bail facing charges in connection to the McConville murder. Bell faces charges of aiding and abetting the killing. Bell, who was expelled from the IRA in the early 1980s after being accused of attempting to stage an internal coup against its leadership, denies all the charges.\n\nOne of McConville's children who witnessed her abduction in front of several male and female IRA members, Helen McKendry, told the Guardian she and her husband Seamus were \"pleasantly optimistic\" that justice would finally be done for her mother.\n\nSeamus McKendry, who along with his wife started the campaign in 1994 to highlight the plight of the Disappeared \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the 16 IRA victims shot and buried in secret during the 1970s and 80s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 said: \"The family are quite happy that Adams is being questioned about Jean's murder. But even if this inquiry fails we have always made clear that we will pursue a civil legal action against Adams.\"He said: \"It should be noted that the IRA and people in Sinn Fein like Mr Adams always insisted that this was a war. Under the Geneva convention to 'disappear' someone in a war is a war crime. He should keep that in mind in these days ahead because it has long been our view that what happened to Jean was a war crime.\"\n\nMcKendry and his wife said Adams facing questions over the murder vindicated the PSNI's pursuit of the Belfast Project Tapes. A number of people have already been arrested and questioned in relation to the McConville killing after the PSNI was able to seize taped testimony from IRA veterans who talked openly to the project about their role in the armed campaign, including the murders of the Disappeared. The tapes were only meant to have been made public once the person who had given candid testimony about their role in the violence had died.\n\nMcKendry said the PSNI's decision to go after the material in the US courts had been justified.\n\n\"We had insisted that the police go after every small piece of the jigsaw in relation to Jean's disappearance and murder. That is why it was right to pursue those tapes. What the family now hope and pray for is that Jean's grandchildren do not have to pass on this fight for justice onto the next generation.\"\n\nIt was a court decision in the US that led to the Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in president being interviewed by police. In 2001, Boston College commenced a five-year oral history project aimed at documenting perspectives on the Troubles from those involved in the conflict.\n\nAcademics, historians and journalists interviewed former paramilitaries, both republican and loyalist, about their roles in the 40 years of violence that blighted Northern Ireland. The participants took part on the undertaking that their accounts would only be made public upon their death.\n\nWhen one such interviewee, former IRA commander in Belfast Brendan Hughes died in 2008, his tapes contained an allegation that Adams was a senior IRA leader during the Troubles and that he had ordered McConville's killing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 claims that the Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in leader vehemently contested.\n\nPrior to her death last year, Old Bailey bomber Dolours Price made further allegations separate to the Boston College project. Again the Louth TD rejected the claims.\n\nThe revelations prompted lawyers representing the PSNI to launch a legal bid in the US to obtain the relevant Boston College tapes. A court battle ensued, but last year the PSNI won and the college was ordered to pass over the tapes.\n\nHaving taken time to examine their contents, detectives have ramped up their investigation in the last two months, making a series of arrests. In March veteran republican Ivor Bell, 77, from Ramoan Gardens in the Andersonstown district of west Belfast, was charged with aiding and abetting in the murder \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a count he denies. Five others have been detained and questioned by detectives, culminating in the arrest of Adams.",

                "text": "Richard Desmond is poised to announce the sale of Channel 5 to the US broadcaster that owns MTV for as much as \u00a3450m.\n\nUS media group Viacom, which owns channels including Nickelodeon and Comedy Central, is expected to announce the deal on Thursday when it reports its latest financial results.\n\nThe price tag falls short of the aggressive \u00a3700m-plus target originally set by Desmond, the owner of the Daily Express and Daily Star newspapers.\n\nNonetheless, it represents a significant profit on the \u00a3103.5m the media tycoon paid to buy the then loss-making Channel 5 from the German broadcaster RTL in 2010. Desmond turned the business round by slashing costs and bringing Big Brother over from Channel 4, while boosting his other investments by broadcasting regular adverts for his press titles. It is not clear what Viacom will do with Channel 5's \u00a3350m-a-year TV ad sales business. But it is thought likely that it will involve Rupert Murdoch's Sky.\n\nBSkyB handles the TV ad sales in the UK for Viacom \u2013 the US broadcaster is Sky Media's biggest customer \u2013 and it is most likely to incorporate Channel 5's sales into its existing deal.\n\nDesmond based his valuation on 10 times anticipated profits of \u00a370m this year, but a number of analysts had set a top end valuation of \u00a3400m to \u00a3500m.\n\nThe deal would allow Viacom, a big player in the cable network business in the US, to make a major move into free-to-air television in the UK. On these shores its most ambitious broadcasting move in recent years has been\n\na move into commissioning more original, homegrown shows for its key channels MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon.\n\nViacom has invested heavily in entertainment, reality and children's television, which fits into Channel 5's current schedules. It makes shows such as MTV's reality series Geordie Shore \u2013 which made a star of Charlotte Crosby, who went on to win Channel 5's Celebrity Big Brother.\n\nIn addition, along with Channel 5, Viacom invested in Peppa Pig via Nick Jr, which airs on Channel 5's children's slot and on the Nick Jr channel.\n\nChannel 5 shows include the US drama imports CSI and The Mentalist, Edie Stobart: Trucks & Trailers, The Hotel Inspector and Extreme Fishing with Robson Green. The broadcaster's children's strand Milkshake features shows including Peppa Pig, Fireman Sam and Thomas & Friends.\n\nChannel 5 has six channels \u2013 the flagship Channel 5, 5* and 5 USA, and a +1, one-hour time-shifted variant for each \u2013 some of which could be converted to pay services.\n\nRivals including BSkyB and Discovery, which was considered the frontrunner to buy Channel 5, have expanded their operations into the free-to-air market. BSkyB is expected to have an involvement in Channel 5 if Viacom pulls off a takeover, by taking over the broadcaster's advertising sales and giving it greater competitive clout against bigger rivals ITV and Channel 4.\n\nViacom declined to comment. Northern & Shell, Channel 5's parent company, said no deal had been concluded.\n\n\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

                "text": "Discovery Communications has withdrawn its bid for Richard Desmond's Channel 5, which is thought to leave MTV owner Viacom as one of the few remaining potential buyers.\n\nUS factual broadcaster Discovery made a bid earlier this week in the second round of the acquisition process, but in the latest twist in the long-running Channel 5 sale saga has now dropped out of the running, MediaGuardian understands.\n\nAccording to sources Discovery's offer was thought to be in the region of \u00a3250m to \u00a3300m, and was made in association with BSkyB.\n\nHowever, it is thought that BSkyB's involvement was limited to handling Channel 5's advertising sales on behalf of Discovery, rather than taking an equity stake in the free-to-air broadcaster. Sky already handles ad sales for Discovery's UK pay-TV channels.\n\nThe Discovery bid was markedly below the \u00a3700m price tag that Northern & Shell media group and Channel 5 owner Desmond reportedly wants.\n\nViacom \u2013 which owns including MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central \u2013 is also said to have made an offer for Channel 5, again with involvement from BSkyB handling the broadcaster's ad sales. Sky already sells advertising for Viacom's UK channels.\n\nPrice is thought to be have been the key reason for Discovery dropping out.\n\nAdvertising sales are understood to have been a focus for those who have been through Channel 5's books. The broadcaster's TV ad sales operation brings in about \u00a3350m a year, but it is thought that some potential bidders were concerned about the impact of the cross-selling and promotion across Northern & Shell on the figures and the value of free publicity Channel 5 gets from Desmond's newspapers. Northern & Shell's ad spend with Channel 5 is estimated to be worth \u00a330m a year.\n\nSome doubts are now being cast on whether the process will achieve the price tag Desmond wants if negotiations with Viacom fail to come to fruition and that the whole process could run out of steam.\n\nTwo sources suggested that it could play a part in a wider, sophisticated refinancing picture being looked at by Desmond that requires a valuation of assets \u2013 with one claiming the company would like a valuation of \u00a3400m-plus for Channel 5.\n\nAnother source familiar with the situation said those involved are not holding their breath for an imminent sale and that Desmond may decide not sell at all.\n\n\"It is about getting the price that will satisfy Richard Desmond. People have now put money on the table. It is about how much people are prepared to pay him for it and how willing Desmond is to sell,\" this source said.\n\n\"The offers are all being considered by the powers that be but people do not expect anything for a while.\"\n\nDesmond went through a less formal process of touting for potential buyers for his four Express Newspapers titles three years ago, with Barclays Capital circulating a two-page prospectus to interested parties.\n\nHowever, in this instance there was no official mandate for a sale and Desmond later told the Guardian Barclays Capital \"never came back and said we've got a buyer\" and in any case \"I wouldn't really like to sell\".\n\n\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

The other two were between 13 and 15 when the crimes charged against Johnson happened, they testified -- although the girl victimized in one of the first-degree penetration counts testified she was only 10 when Johnson began touching her sexually.\n\n\n\nThe sexual assaults alleged in the charges against Johnson happened over a number of years until 2012, when the police investigation began after one of the girls came forward.\n\nBut Johnson\u2019s raping of other young female family members started decades before that, according to corroborating testimony by about a half-dozen other women who said they\u2019d been his victims over the years.\n\nOne woman, now a 70-year-old California resident, testified Johnson sexually assaulted her as long ago as 1957.\n\nAccording to testimony at the four-day trial, the rapes sometimes happened in the basement of Johnson\u2019s home, sometimes in his office at Faith Congregational Church of God in Christ, 509 Jackson Ave., where Johnson used the title of bishop.\n\n\u201cIt was justice a long time coming,\u201d said Muskegon County Assistant Prosecutor Rachael McEnhill, who prosecuted the case, after the verdict.\n\nAsked why decades of sexual abuse hadn\u2019t been disclosed sooner, McEnhill said, \u201cI think that there was a lot of family pressure and pressure within the church. And according to the expert that testified, it is very common for people to go their entire lives without disclosing sexual abuse.\u201d\n\nSentencing on the first-degree convictions could range up to life in prison, with 15 years the maximum on the second-degree count.\n\nIn her closing argument to jurors, McEnhill pointed to a slide of the church\u2019s signboard, with the slogan \u201cTOGETHER WE CAN DO IT.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here,\u201d McEnhill said. \u201cWe\u2019re here because this family and this church kept a secret for 50 years. ... Because victim after victim after victim was raped ... These three girls were brave enough (to tell the truth). And it is compelling, and it is true.\u201d\n\nShe said none of the women testifying had anything to gain, and plenty to lose, by making up the accusations.\n\nIn his closing argument, Muskegon County Public Defender Fred Johnson argued that the case defied credibility, that such conduct couldn\u2019t have been hidden in an active house where family members constantly came in and out.\n\nJohnson attributed what he suggested were false allegations to tensions within the family and church. \u201cThis is a family issue,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThis is a terribly dysfunctional family ... and it hasn\u2019t been proven to be anything else.\u201d",

CNB officers followed up with a raid of his residence and found another 22.3g of synthetic cannabis.\n\nHe is being investigated for trafficking in a controlled drug.

                "text": "SINGAPORE \u2014 The authorities have moved to reclassify a list of so-called \u201clegal highs\u201d \u2014 which mimic the effects of drugs such as cocaine and Ecstasy \u2014 as Class A controlled drugs, making the abuse of such substances an offence punishable by imprisonment and caning.\n\nKnown as New Psychoactive Substances (NPS), they are mainly produced by introducing slight modifications to the chemical structures of controlled drugs. They were listed in the Fifth Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act enacted last year, which allows the authorities to seize them, but the trafficking, manufacture, import, export, possession or consumption of them did not constitute an offence.\n\nWith the reclassification, anyone found guilty of trafficking any NPS will face at least five years in jail and five strokes of the cane. A person found abusing any NPS can be jailed for up to 10 years, fined up to $20,000, or both.\n\nThe change takes effect today. Announcing the move, the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) said that, globally, there has been an increase in the number of cases of NPS trafficking and abuse in the past year. A CNB spokesperson said that between May 1 last year and the end of February this year, it had seized such substances on at least 30 occasions.\n\n\u201cThus far, synthetic cannabinoids and synthetic cathinones are the two more commonly detected NPS,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nSuch substances have been linked to adverse physical and psychological reactions, including paranoia, seizures, hallucinations and even death. \u201cGiven these developments and the fact that these substances mimic the effects of harmful Class A drugs, CNB has decided to list all the Fifth Schedule drugs to the First Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act as Class A controlled drugs,\u201d the CNB said.\n\nIt added that consultations with the Health Sciences Authority, research institutes and industry stakeholders have found that there are currently no known medical and industrial uses for these substances.\n\nIn its World Drug Report 2013, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime called NPS an \u201calarming new drug problem\u201d. Much of these drugs are legal and are marketed as \u201clegal highs\u201d, \u201cresearch chemicals\u201d, \u201cplant food\u201d and \u201cbath salts\u201d. The report said the number of such substances is growing steadily at the global level, jumping from 251 in 2012 to 348 last year.\n\nThe Fifth Schedule was enacted last year to list these substances temporarily. As time is needed to study a drug before it can be made illegal, the temporary listing of a substance on the Fifth Schedule allowed the authorities to seize it so its circulation could be restricted.\n\nThe announcement yesterday marked the first time Fifth Schedule-listed substances were reclassified as controlled drugs.\n\nIn a statement, CNB Director Ng Ser Song said: \u201cThe drug situation is challenging and the number of repeat drug abusers and young drug abusers remains a concern. With the abuse and trafficking of NPS on the rise, listing these new psychoactive substances as Class A controlled drugs signals our unequivocal stance that these substances are illegal and no different from other controlled drugs.\u201d",

                "text": "The 950 residents of Cape St. George, a town in Newfoundland and Labrador, are grappling with how to dispose of the dead sperm whale that washed up on its beach about five days ago.\n\nAt first they tried to sell it, thinking a museum might want it \u2013 and they could make some money for that skate park the kids in town want.\n\nSo, for a brief time Monday, the mayor and his council had the 12-metre sperm whale for auction on eBay. It was going well for several hours \u2013 70 bids worth about $2,000 \u2013 until the online site shut it down, citing its policy against \u201clisting mammal parts,\u201d said Mayor Peter Fenwick, in a telephone interview. Cape St. George is located on the southwestern tip of Newfoundland\u2019s Port au Port Peninsula.\n\nAround the same time, the federal Environment Department called, threatening the town with prosecution if it didn\u2019t remove it, the mayor says. \u201cIt turns out that the sperm whale, which in my opinion is quite abundant, is on the endangered species list and you can\u2019t sell any of it,\u201d he said.\n\nNow, the town is offering it for free. The mayor is hoping one of the bidders on eBay is still interested \u201cin moving the darn thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in half decent shape,\u201d Mr. Fenwick said. \u201cThis one looks like it died very recently and hasn\u2019t decomposed much.\u201d\n\nHe and his council called an emergency meeting Sunday and decided to take the unusual action of auctioning off the whale \u2013 they also considered Kijiji \u2013 after federal and provincial government officials told them, \u201cIt\u2019s your problem, you solve it,\u201d the mayor said.\n\nThe beast is lying on the beach very close to some houses and fishing stations, so when it starts to decompose it will be a \u201creal nuisance,\u201d the mayor said, referring to the stench.\n\nWayne Ledwell of Newfoundland\u2019s Whale Release and Strandings, an expert on saving entangled whales, had advised the town to tow the whale out to an isolated area and let \u201cnature take its course.\u201d\n\nThe mayor said they had tried that. They asked a local fisherman, the one with the largest boat in town, to tow it away but he took one look at it and didn\u2019t think his engine was big enough.\n\n\u201cThey need to do that right away, when they come in and they\u2019re fresh,\u201d Mr. Ledwell says. \u201cNo one wants to go touch them \u2026 everything becomes gooey and slippery and you can\u2019t stand up on the whale and it gets on your boots and you can\u2019t get the smell off and then you go home and the dog rolls in it and you get it in your kitchen and you curse the whales, and you curse the government and \u2026 it becomes a mess.\u201d\n\nMr. Ledwell says it has been a \u201cbad year\u201d for whales washing ashore.\n\nMr. Fenwick knows that his sperm whale \u2013 he\u2019s calling it the \u201cpride of Cape St. George \u2013 can\u2019t compete with the huge blue whales. But he notes that the sperm whale is the largest of the \u201ctoothed whales\u201d and says it would be a great attraction for a museum. It has a \u201chuge lower jaw\u201d and \u201cbig domed forehead.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything you ever saw on Moby Dick,\u201d he adds.",

Call 709-644-2290 or 709-649-7070 for more details.\"\n\nThe ad has sparked some discussion on Twitter about whether marine mammal parts can be sold on eBay.\n\nAnother website www.skullsunlimited.com regularly sells marine mammal parts and currently has a minke whale skull for sale for $3,450 and sperm whale tooth priced at $39.\n\nThe eBay listing for the Cape St. George whale can be viewed HERE.\n\nTown to auction off dead whale on eBay\n\nThe Town of Cape St. George is turning to eBay in an attempt to get rid of a dead beached whale.\n\nThe town is asking for bids on the dead 40-foot sperm whale that landed on the beach at Marche's Point last week. The listing on eBay is for seven days and the successful bidder will have to remove the whale within 30 days.\n\n\"The 40 foot sperm whale will make a spectacular exhibit once the fat and muscle is removed, and the town is asking museums and other organizations that could use a whale skeleton to contact the town for further details,\" Mayor Peter Fenwick said in a news release.\n\n\"As a town we would dearly love to keep the whale and put it on exhibit in the town but the cost of such a venture would be hard to justify,\u201d Fenwick added.\n\nAnyone interested in purchasing the whale carcass can contact the town at 709-644-2290 or Mr. Fenwick at 709-649-7070.",

Bidding had jumped from $238.03 to $2,075 within a couple of hours Monday before the auction was closed.\n\nDespite the setback, Fenwick is sure the whale\u2019s skeleton would be a welcome addition to a museum somewhere.\n\n\u201cOur major objective was to get rid of the whale, and we feel that there may be enough out there who know about it, who may be interested in it,\u201d said Fenwick.\n\n\u201cIf they want a free whale, we\u2019ll be glad to give it to them, provided they can make suitable arrangements to remove it from the beach and put it in a place where it\u2019s not a major annoyance to the community.\u201d\n\nFenwick said the whale carcass lies in cold water and hasn\u2019t begun to rot.

However, as of Monday afternoon, the auction has been taken down by eBay for violating the company\u2019s policy against selling marine animal parts.\n\nBefore being removed from the website around 2:30 p.m., the highest bid was $2,025.\n\nBut eBay wasn\u2019t the only group to have a problem with the sale. Environment Canada had also informed Cape St. George mayor Peter Fenwick that selling parts of a sperm whale violates Canada\u2019s federal act protecting species at risk.\n\nFenwick says this isn't the first time a whale has washed ashore in the small town.\n\nHe told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview on Monday that a 15-foot pot whale washed ashore several years ago, but it disappeared without the town being notified. Fenwick suspects that the federal Fisheries Department took it away.\n\n\"This time the authorities have told us that it's our whale, it's our responsibility to get rid of it,\" he said.\n\nFenwick said he hopes one of the bidders on the eBay auction is still interested in his community\u2019s sperm whale.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be glad to talk to them about giving them the whale,\u201d Fenwick said during a phone interview on CTV News Channel. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that\u2019s not illegal.\u201d\n\nFenwick said the town originally looked at moving the whale with the help of a 50-foot boat, but it wasn't strong enough to move the animal.\n\nHe said the online listing was the only solution to the whale problem that the town could afford.\n\nThe whale hasn't started to decompose, something Fenwick attributes to the fact that it's still partly in the water that remains at near freezing temperatures. But he noted that the mammal is beached close to a number of houses and those residents are \"very interested in seeing the whale gone.\"\n\nFenwick added a museum might still want to take the carcass, as the Royal Ontario Museum has already offered to preserve the skeletons of two blue whales that washed ashore last week on Newfoundland\u2019s west coast.\n\n\u201cSay there was a museum somewhere that wanted to put on an exhibit like that,\u201d said Fenwick. \u201cIf they can get in touch with us, we\u2019d be happy to donate that whale to them.\u201d",

In Newfoundland, animal carcasses are the responsibility of the municipality they wash up in, even if they\u2019re 12 metres long and weigh 25 or 30 tons like this one does.\n\nDisposing of a dead whale is no easy task and whether its buried, towed out to sea or sliced up to preserve the bones, it requires equipment and funds the town just doesn\u2019t have. Although Fenwick said he\u2019d like to preserve the bones, \u201cit\u2019s just not within our financial capability.\u201d\n\nBidding started at 99 cents and was past $2,000 by the time the auction was taken offline. Although quite accurately placed in the \u201creally weird\u201d category, the auction violated eBay\u2019s rules which state \u201citems made from marine mammals regardless of when the product was made\u201d are prohibited.\n\nHowever, that was only one of the wrinkles in Fenwick\u2019s plan. The second came in the form of a call from the federal government on Monday afternoon.\n\n\u201cI received a call from the federal department of the environment saying that you\u2019re not allowed to sell any parts of sperm whales, even if they\u2019re dead,\u201d said Fenwick.\n\n\u201cSo I said, \u2018Oh that\u2019s very good, I\u2019m glad to hear that, now can you send somebody over here to get rid of it for us?\u2019\u201d\n\nThey said they could not.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got to sort it out somehow. The uncertainty means it just sort of sits there and rots,\u201d said Fenwick.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever seen a whale that\u2019s been rotting on the beach for a couple of months \u2014 actually sometimes you can\u2019t see it for the clouds of flies around it \u2014 but you can smell it for about a mile.\u201d\n\nThe whale is currently half-submerged in cold Gulf of St. Lawrence water so it\u2019s not too foul at the moment.\n\nThe lack of aid from the provincial and federal government when it comes to big, stinky carcasses is a familiar story for two towns north of Cape St. George \u2014 Rocky Harbour and Trout River. Blue whales carcasses washed up in both towns and, also lacking the funds to tackle the problem themselves, the local councils were at a loss. Lucky for them, the Royal Ontario Museum has stepped up to help remove the whales and preserve their skeletons.\n\nCape St. George is hoping to attract interest from a museum or other organization that wants the sperm whale\u2019s bones for display.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re not allowed to sell it, we\u2019re willing to drop our 99 cent price down to a zero,\u201d said Fenwick.\n\nThe original listing read:\n\n This 40 foot sperm whale rolled up on the beach last week. The actual seller is the town of Cape St. George which is responsible for disposing of it before it starts to decay. Once the fat and flesh is removed you have a spectacular 40 foot skeleton of the largest toothed whale in the world, great for museums and other attractions. To prevent it rotting in the town it can be towed to isolated beaches on the Port au Port Peninsula to allow the seagulls and other birds to remove the flesh. Call 709-644-2290 or 709-649-7070 for more details. Please note the successful bidder will have to remove the whale within 30 days",

                "text": "Update: On May 8, 2014, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence approved the USA Freedom Act without changes. The bill will now be considered by the full US House of Representatives.\n\n(Washington, DC) \u2013 The US House Judiciary Committee took a long overdue step on May 7, 2014, with its move to reform one aspect of the government\u2019s mass surveillance programs, Human Rights Watch said today. The committee approved unanimously a revised version of the USA Freedom Act that would aim to end the government\u2019s bulk collection of telephone metadata and other records in the United States. \n\n \n\n Ending bulk metadata and records collection is a critical component of the reforms needed to rein in the US government\u2019s mass surveillance programs, Human Rights Watch said.\n\n \n\n \u201cThe USA Freedom Act revision would help end one of the most problematic programs Edward Snowden revealed last year,\u201d said Cynthia Wong, senior Internet researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cHowever, the bill does not address needed reforms to surveillance programs that affect millions of people outside US borders.\u201d\n\n \n\n The compromise bill aims to prohibit bulk collection of records by the government, including phone and internet metadata, under several existing laws. These changes address key reforms that many nongovernmental organizations, including Human Rights Watch, have urged.\n\n \n\n However, several proposed reforms that were also much needed from the prior version of the USA Freedom Act have been removed or weakened. For example, there is no longer a provision that creates a special advocate to argue the public\u2019s interest in the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court. The amended version also fails to incorporate another provision from the original draft, which removed a requirement that a judge considering a challenge to a gag order must treat government claims that disclosure would harm national security as conclusive. \n\n \n\n On May 8, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence is expected to review the USA Freedom Act, as well as its own bill. Although many important reforms remain outstanding, the intelligence committee should pass the amended USA Freedom Act without further weakening it, and Congress should move swiftly to advance the proposal, Human Rights Watch said.\n\n \n\n The compromise version of the bill incorporates many of the proposals put forward this year by President Barack Obama. It intends to prohibit the type of sweeping collection of records that has been authorized in the past by requiring agencies to at least designate \u201cspecific selection terms\u201d as the basis for a request. This requirement is intended to prevent collection of all phone records, as well as other kinds of business records, under Section 215 of the Patriot Act and other relevant laws. The effectiveness of this requirement will depend on how this term is interpreted in practice.\n\n \n\n The bill also creates new government reporting requirements, allows companies to report limited information about the orders they receive, provides a mechanism for emergency requests, and establishes a panel of experts that the FISA court may ask to intervene in specific cases. \n\n \n\n But the bill would do little to increase protections for the right to privacy for people outside the US, a key problem that plagues US surveillance activities. Nor would the bill address mass surveillance or bulk collection practices that may be occurring under other laws or regulations, such as Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act or Executive Order 12333. These practices affect many more people and include the collection of the actual content of internet communications and phone calls, not just metadata.\n\n \n\n \u201cWithout deeper reform, the US risks helping to create a world in which nobody can feel safe communicating online,\u201d Wong said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Congress to correct course, not only by quickly approving this bill but also by promptly bringing about deeper reforms to NSA surveillance.\u201d",

                "text": "For the first time since Edward Snowden revealed some of the National Security Agency\u2019s (NSA\u2019s) surveillance programs last June, a congressional committee has voted to send legislation intended to curb the government\u2019s spying power on for a full vote. On Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee passed a version of the USA Freedom Act, considered by civil liberties advocates to be among the strongest of several competing reform bills.\n\nBut what lawmakers voted unanimously to approve is a trimmed down version that is narrower in significant ways. The revision is the result of an agreement crafted by members of the Judiciary Committee\u2014 including Republican chairman Bob Goodlatte, who voted previously against an attempt to limit the NSA\u2019s reach\u2014in a bid to win wider support. In its compromised form the bill is more specifically focused on the phone records program and the statute that authorizes it, Section 215 of the Patriot Act.\n\nUnder the amended version of the bill, the government itself would no longer be allowed to hold a database of people\u2019s calling records, and would have to seek a judge\u2019s order before collecting data held by the telecom companies\u2014a change that President Obama has said he would support. The bill would also increase transparency by allowing phone companies to inform the public about the requests for data they receive.\n\n\u201cI think we can call it a milestone. It is the first bill that\u2019s really got momentum behind it and that would truly rein in the bulk collection programs,\u201d said Gabe Rottman, legislative council for the American Civil Liberties Union. Still, he acknowledged that the amended version \u201cis a compromise bill, and it\u2019s not as strong as the original sense of the proposal.\u201d\n\nCut out of the amended version is a ban on unauthorized \u201cback door\u201d searches, the practice of mining a database of foreigners\u2019 communications for the emails and phone calls of American citizens. Such searches are made under a different authority, Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which lawmakers left untouched during Wednesday\u2019s markup. The amendment also softened reforms to the secret court that authorizes the NSA\u2019s surveillance activities, and preserved the requirement that the government need only prove \u201creasonable articulable suspicion\u201d that records sought are relevant to an open investigation\u2014the NSA\u2019s preferred relevancy standard.\n\n\u201cRight now, [the USA Freedom Act] is good on one small piece of the surveillance pie,\u201d said Mark Jaycox, a legislative analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cIt is a good step towards fixing Section 215, but it\u2019s lacking in what the USA Freedom Act originally envisioned, which was an overarching bill that touched on many of the different spying authorities and activities we\u2019ve learned about.\u201d\n\nCalifornia representative Zoe Lofgren proposed a number of amendments intended to restore the bill to its wider scope. \u201cThe biggest disappointment I have about the [amended version] is that it took meaningful reform\u2026 and watered it down significantly,\u201d Lofgren said as she argued for reinstating the ban on back door searches. But Lofgren\u2019s revisions were shot down even by James Sensenbrenner, the Republican co-author of the original USA Freedom Act, who summed up the prevailing attitude when he cautioned his colleagues \u201cnot to make the perfect the enemy of the good.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe finally have a bill that can actually pass, and this amendment would probably upset that ability to pass a bill,\u201d said New York Democrat Jerrold Nadler, who objected to a Lofgren proposal to raise the relevancy standard from reasonable articulable suspicion to a tougher requirement that the government demonstrate probable cause. Nadler called the act \u201cthe first, best and perhaps only chance in a decade\u201d to reform the NSA.\n\nThe revisions to the bill were significant enough to earn tentative approval from one of the NSA\u2019s most ardent allies, Intelligence Committee chairman Mike Rogers. After the Judiciary Committee made a surprise announcement early in the week that it would move on the USA Freedom Act, Rogers immediately announced the Intelligence Committee would, on Thursday, mark up his own bill, the FISA Transparency and Modernization Act, which is much softer than the original USA Freedom Act.\n\nBut the distinctions between the two have grown sufficiently murky to prompt Rogers to indicate that he might end up supporting the USA Freedom Act after all. \u201cThey\u2019ve come a lot closer [and] now we\u2019re just trying to work out the wording,\u201d Rogers told Foreign Policy on Tuesday. Important differences do remain, however; under the Rogers legislation, for example, the government would not need a judge\u2019s permission to probe phone and email data.\n\nIn general, civil liberties advocates are pleased that Congress is finally moving on surveillance reform, even if addressing Section 215 only gets at one of the programs revealed so far by the Snowden documents. Besides Section 702, there are untouched issues related to an executive order expanding presidential authority (Executive Order 12333), the use of which for legal grounding for spying activities in not yet well understood. But because the phone metadata program is easiest to understand and has attracted the most attention, it\u2019s not surprising that it is Congress\u2019s first target. The bill is likely to have strong support on the floor, particularly as it is now closely aligned with changes explicitly supported by Obama and has been made more palatable to people like Rogers.\n\nBut there\u2019s valid concern that the phone records program will turn out to be a sacrificial lamb for the administration, something given up in the hopes that Congress will wash its hands of the rest. The dragnet is not disappearing under the USA Freedom Act; metadata will still be available to the government, if not quite so freely; and a single court order will allow officials to explore phone records two \u201chops\u201d away from the initial target\u2014potentially millions of records. It\u2019s unclear whether the bill explicitly bars intelligence agencies from collecting the contents of communications under Section 215, a provision that originally distinguished the USA Freedom Act from Rogers\u2019s bill. Though the ban was absent in the version that passed the committee, Lofgren speculated that the omission was due to a clerical error. What\u2019s for sure is that Congress\u2019s ability to truly reform\u2014and oversee\u2014 the intelligence community remains unclear.\n\n\u201cCertainly there\u2019s a concern that they can say, \u2018we fixed it and we\u2019re done.\u2019 But I don\u2019t think that any of the groups that are concerned about this or, frankly, the American public will let that happen,\u201d Rottman said.\n\nPlease support our journalism. Get a digital subscription for just $9.50!\n\nSeveral of the NSA\u2019s critics in Congress said that they too will continue to press for stronger measures. \u201cI remain concerned that the legislation approved today does not include some of the important reforms related to national security letters, a strong special advocate at the FISA Court, and greater transparency,\u201d Vermont senator and Judiciary chair Patrick Leahy said in a statement. \u201cI will continue to push for those reforms when the Senate Judiciary Committee considers the USA Freedom Act this summer.\u201d\n\nOregon Senator Ron Wyden said he \u201cwill continue to fight for additional steps to protect both American security and American liberty, like closing the back door searches loophole and installing a constitutional advocate at the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\u201d",

                "text": "The bill\u2019s architect, Republican James Sensenbrenner, said the bill 'makes it crystal clear that Congress does not support bulk collection.' Photo: Chip Somodevilla /Getty\n\nSix months after it was written to restrain the National Security Agency\u2019s sweeping domestic surveillance, a privacy bill cleared a major legislative obstacle on Wednesday, even as its advocates worried that the compromises made to advance the bill have weakened its constraints on mass data collection.\n\n\n\nThe USA Freedom Act, designed to prevent the US government from collecting US phone data in bulk, passed the House Judiciary Committee by a 32 to zero bi-partisan vote, making it the first surveillance reform bill to proceed out of committee and to the House floor.\n\nBut an internal committee breakthrough on Monday that won the support of chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican, significantly recast the bill, softening its prohibitions on aspects of bulk collection and requiring transparency around it.\n\nThe bill\u2019s architect, Republican James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, who also wrote the 2001 Patriot Act, said the bill \u201cmakes it crystal clear that Congress does not support bulk collection.\u201d\n\nWhile changes to the bill now permit the government to gather call records up to two degrees of separation away from a specific target \u2013 potentially millions of records \u2013 Sensenbrenner urged his colleagues \u201cnot to make the perfect the enemy of the good,\u201d expressing confidence that the revamped USA Freedom Act was on \u201cthe fast track to passage.\u201d\n\nSupporters in and outside of Congress concede the latest compromises have left the USA Freedom Act less protective of civil liberties than it was when introduced in October. Its distinctions from a rival bill written by the leaders of the House intelligence committee, the NSA\u2019s strongest Capitol Hill advocates, are somewhat blurred, prompting civil libertarians to become less enthusiastic of a measure they have championed as a fix to the broad NSA powers exposed by whistleblower Edward Snowden.\n\nRepresentative John Conyers, a Michigan Democrat and longtime USA Freedom Act supporter, said that the new version of the bill was a \u201cless than perfect compromise\u201d that still makes \u201cimportant, vital, substantive changes\u201d to US surveillance.\n\nThe revised USA Freedom Act, \u201cwhile still better than any other proposal on the board, is a setback from the original,\u201d said Amie Stepanovich of Access, a human rights and digital rights advocacy group.\n\nWhile the USA Freedom Act has nearly 150 House co-sponsors, and a stalled Senate companion commands 20 votes in the upper chamber, it was clear on Wednesday that the House intelligence committee will continue attempts to outmaneuvre its rival.\n\nThe chairman of the intelligence committee, until now a fervent critic of the USA Freedom Act, is now praising a bill he has long criticized, and which several congressional sources said he attempted to influence ahead of Wednesday\u2019s vote.\n\nRepresentative Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican who is retiring this year, called the changes to the USA Freedom Act a \u201chuge improvement,\u201d adding in an interview with Foreign Policy magazine that the bill\u2019s architects have \u201ccome a lot closer [and] now we're just trying to work out the wording.\u201d\n\nRogers is scheduled to mark up his alternative bill, the Fisa Transparency and Modernization Act, on Thursday, a decision USA Freedom Act supporters view as a desperation move. But on Wednesday, Rogers\u2019 committee announced it will also mark up the USA Freedom Act on Thursday, prompting Capitol Hill speculation that Rogers will attempt to merge his bill with the Freedom Act rather than attempt to rally more votes.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner of Ohio had earlier thrown his support behind Rogers\u2019 bill. But now Boehner is said to be monitoring the committe process and keeping his options open. Congressional sources expected Boehner to schedule a vote on a surveillance proposal \u2013 of whatever form \u2013 as early as the week of 19 May, so the issue does not derail the annual defense budget authorization, though nothing is scheduled yet.\n\nBoth bills as originally crafted prevent the NSA from collecting US phone data in bulk, as it has done in secret since 2001, a position that President Barack Obama now embraces. The major difference between the two bills remains the role of judges in authorizing data collection. The Rogers bill permits the government to collect phone and email data absent a judges\u2019 prior order, which the revised USA Freedom Act requires in all but emergency cases.\n\nAdditionally, the revised USA Freedom Act permits the government to get phone data two \u201chops,\u201d or degrees of separation, from the target of the order, which can mean millions of call records reaped from a single court order. The legal standard for that order, for counterterrorism purposes, will be \u201creasonable articulable suspicion\u201d of connection to an agent of a foreign power, the NSA\u2019s desired framework.\n\nSignificantly, the new version of the USA Freedom Act all but stripped out a provision preventing the NSA from combing through its foreign communications dragnets for Americans\u2019 information, something Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon dubbed the \u201cbackdoor search provision,\u201d an absence that has deeply upset supporters. Those dragnets exist pursuant to a major 2008 piece of legislation, known as Section 702 of the Fisa Amendments Act.\n\nCongressional sources pointed to new language tightening up prohibitions on the NSA intentionally targeting Americans\u2019 communications at the outset as a palliative. But they conceded the absence of the backdoor search ban was a major change \u2013 one they said the NSA\u2019s advocates fought hard for, an indication of how central the NSA considers a power it has rarely forthrightly acknowledged using. They indicated that USA Freedom Act supporters lacked the votes within the committee to pass the bill that retained the backdoor search prohibition.\n\nAn attempt by Representative Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat, to restore the backdoor search provision failed Wednesday. Goodlatte said restoring it would \u201cdisrupt this bipartisan agreement.\u201d\n\nKevin Bankston of the Open Technology Institute said he was \u201cincredibly disappointed\u201d at the new USA Freedom Act\u2019s effective blessing of backdoor searches.\n\n\u201cEspecially when we\u2019re expecting the government\u2019s own surveillance watchdog, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, to issue a report on just that issue within a month or so, closing the door to reform on Section 702 of the Fisa Amendments Act would be premature,\u201d Bankston said in a statement.\n\nBut the Judiciary Committee restored a provision initially struck from the original USA Freedom Act permitting increased transparency for companies receiving surveillance orders for their customers\u2019 data, the absence of which had alarmed supporters.\n\nThe language, added back to the bill Wednesday by Representative Suzan Delbene of Washington, had been cut in order to codify a January deal the Justice Department reached with phone and Internet companies allowing them to list received orders only in bands of 1,000 and with a time lag. Congressional sources said companies lobbied hard to restore transparency language.\n\nThe Obama administration has withheld endorsement of either bill in public, confusing supporters. But in recent weeks, its guidance to Capitol Hill on surveillance reform included a requirement for up-front judicial authorization for data requests, which only the USA Freedom Act possesses.\n\n\n\n\u201cAt this stage, I think I'd just say we will be watching closely as these bills go through the process,\u201d said Caitlin Hayden, a White House spokeswoman said shortly before the vote. \n\n\n\nHours after the vote, Hayden issued a statement welcoming the USA Freedom Act as \"a very good first step\":\n\n\"In March the president laid out his proposal to reform Section 215, and called upon Congress to act quickly to pass implementing legislation. We applaud the House Judiciary Committee for approaching this issue on a bipartisan basis. The Judiciary Committee passed bill is a very good first step in that important effort, and we look forward to House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence action on it tomorrow,\" Hayden said.\n\nSection 215 of the Patriot Act is the provision cited by the NSA and blessed by the secret Fisa Court for bulk data collection.\n\n\n\nSome legislators, distressed by the changes to the USA Freedom Act, are considering a different option for surveillance reform.\n\nAs amended, the USA Freedom Act would push back the expiration of Section 215 to the end of 2017, when Section 702 is set to expire. The current expiration is 1 June of next year. Some legislators are already whispering that allowing Section 215 to expire wholesale in 2015 is a preferable reform.\n\nBut Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, a Democrat, said the USA Freedom Act was \u201cthe first, best and perhaps only chance in a decade\u201d to constrain widespread surveillance.\n\n\u201cThis is our chance. We have to seize it,\u201d Nadler said on Wednesday.\n\nPatrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who sponsored the USA Freedom Act in the Senate, hailed the committee vote, but said he was concerned that the text does not reform the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s national-security letters and makes insufficient changes on transparency and to the Fisa Court. \n\n\n\n\u201cI will continue to push for those reforms when the Senate Judiciary Committee considers the USA Freedom Act this summer,\u201d Leahy said in a statement.\n\n",

                "text": "In a dramatic change of tone, Rep. Mike Rogers, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, praised a bill in the House Judiciary Committee that would sharply curb the National Security Agency's surveillance powers. His remarks suggest that the powerful lawmaker may be more willing to vote for tougher reforms than previously anticipated.\n\nRogers and other national security hawks have spent weeks arguing that the USA Freedom Act, the most aggressive NSA reform bill under consideration in Congress, would remove tools that the government needs to track phone calls by foreign terrorists. Rogers, a staunch NSA supporter, is the sponsor of another bill that would codify many of the surveillance practices opposed by privacy advocates, such as the dragnet collection of records.\n\nHill watchers have long predicted that the bills were on a collision course that would wind up pitting two of the party's most powerful lawmakers, Rogers and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, against each other.\n\nInstead, Rogers said that he had warmed to the Judiciary bill because of a new amendment that would give the NSA broader authority, including the ability to obtain phone data in emergency situations under certain conditions. Surveillance critics worry the amendment has watered down the original bill's privacy protections and transparency requirements.\n\nIn an interview with Foreign Policy, Rogers said those changes constituted a \"huge improvement\" and that he may end up supporting the bill despite the existence of his rival NSA reform bill scheduled for a vote in the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday.\n\n\"I have always been willing to work with people who had serious advice and counsel in how to get this right,\" Rogers said. \"They've come a lot closer [and] now we're just trying to work out the wording.\"\n\nRogers' words come as a surprise to NSA critics in Congress given the substantive differences between the USA Freedom Act and his own bill, even in light of Monday's amendment.\n\n\"It's very encouraging, obviously,\" said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee and a backer of the USA Freedom Act. \"We anticipated that we would have to have a battle between the two committees and if Rogers is signaling we may not have to, that'd be great.\"\n\nThe USA Freedom Act has become more palatable to national security hawks following a compromise by the committee's civil libertarians. On Monday, Goodlatte gave his support to the bill after it was amended to allow the government to collect phone data on U.S. citizens based on a \"reasonable articulable suspicion\" of wrongdoing -- a standard the NSA favors. If approved, the government can collect metadata on individuals who are two degrees or \"hops\" of separation from the suspect under the law. The changes also allow the government to bypass prior judicial approval for phone data in cases of emergencies (i.e. a ticking time bomb scenario).\n\nStill, large substantive gaps remain between the bills in the two committees. Although both proposals would keep phone records in the hands of phone companies as opposed to the NSA, the similarities stop there. The Intelligence bill, for instance, does not require the NSA to obtain prior court approval to query each individual number it wants to see. The Judiciary bill does, except in cases where a terrorist attack is iminent. In such a scenario, the bill requires a determination by the attorney general that the request is reasonable and forces the AG to apply for retroactive court approval within seven days. The Judiciary bill also prohibits the practice of bulk data collection through the use of national security letters (NSLs) while the Intelligence bill does not.\n\nWhile it remains unclear how the two committees will resolve the outstanding differences, the apparent breakthrough is likely to come as a relief to House leadership, which doesn't want a bloody surveillance reform fight to jeopardize other pieces of critical legislation such as the annual defense authorization bill (NDAA).\n\n\"I'm glad that Rogers said that,\" said a Republican House leadership aide. \"It's encouraging that both committees are basically looking for a way forward.\" House leaders have scheduled the NDAA for a floor vote on May 19.\n\nRogers insists he's always been open to responsible compromise, including the consideration of competing bills. \"If we can work this out and have Judiciary be the primary bill, I'm absolutely fine with that,\" he said. \"This is not about pride of authorship for me. It's about how you get this right.\" Rogers still plans to hold a vote on his NSA reform bill on Thursday to keep his options open.\n\nStill, the fate of NSA reform is far from certain. Any compromise to the Judiciary bill risks an insurrection from civil libertarians in Congress. Michigan Republican Justin Amash led such a revolt last year when he offered an NSA amendment to a defense appropriations bill that would have stripped funding for the NSA's collection program. The Amash provision terrified House leadership and nearly passed in a dramatic House floor vote. At the moment, Amash's spokesman said his boss is still reviewing the revised version of the USA Freedom Act to see if he'll lead a similar kind of insurrection.\n\n\"I will carefully review Judiciary Committee-revised version of #FreedomAct,\" Amash tweeted. \"Just a weakened bill or worse than status quo? I'll find out.\"",

                "text": "In the wake of today\u2019s tremendously important ruling by the District Court for the District of Columbia that bulk collection of telephone metadata violates the Fourth Amendment, it is more important than ever that Congress end this misuse of section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act. However, Deputy Attorney General James Cole testified earlier this week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that the NSA might continue its bulk collection of nearly all domestic phone call records, even if the USA FREEDOM ACT passes into law. That must have come as a real surprise to committee chairman Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and the dozens of USA FREEDOM Act\u2019s bipartisan co-sponsors, all of whom agree that the core purpose of the bill is to end NSA dragnet collection of Americans\u2019 communication data.\n\nCole noted the reform legislation wouldn\u2019t necessarily inhibit the NSA\u2019s surveillance capabilities because \u201cit\u2019s going to depend on how the court interprets any number of the provisions that are in [the legislation].\u201d Comments like this betray a serious problem inside the Executive Branch. The Administration and the intelligence community believe they can do whatever they want, regardless of the laws Congress passes, so long they can convince one of the judges appointed to the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to agree. This isn\u2019t the rule of law. This is a coup d\u2019etat.\n\nLeahy\u2019s proposed legislation would amend section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act to require the government to show the records it seeks are not only relevant but also material to an authorized investigation and that the target has some connection to terrorism or espionage before it can obtain those records. This latter requirement, the USA FREEDOM Act sponsors say, will \u201cend bulk collection\u201d.\n\nCole apparently disagrees. Responding to a question at yesterday\u2019s hearing on the bill, Cole said, \u201cRight now the interpretation of the word \u2018relevant\u2019 is a broad interpretation. Adding \u2018pertinent to a foreign agent\u2019 or \u2018somebody in contact with a foreign agent\u2019 could be another way of talking about relevance as it is right now. We\u2019d have to see how broadly the court interprets that or how narrowly.\u201d In other words, the FISA court might let us keep doing what we\u2019re doing no matter what the law says and despite Congress\u2019 intent .\n\nAll courts issue opinions about what the laws that legislatures pass mean. These opinions are called the \u201ccommon law\u201d. But common law interpretations of statutes are only legitimate if they are fair and reasonable interpretations.\n\nThe NSA has a great track record getting FISC judges to interpret even obviously narrow phrases in surprisingly broad ways. For example, Americans, including the Patriot Act\u2019s main sponsor Representative Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) and a co-sponsor of the USA Freedom Act, were shocked to learn last June that the NSA used Section 215 for bulk collection of phone data (and potentially other sensitive records). Sensenbrenner said, \u201c[i]f Congress knew what the NSA had in mind in the future immediately after 9/11, the Patriot Act never would have passed, and I never would have supported it.\u201d\n\nThe 2004 FISC opinion authorizing the NSA\u2019s collection and use of Internet metadata under the pen register statute is another dismaying example of this phenomenon. In this opinion, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly acknowledged that she was allowing an \u201cexceptionally broad\u201d and \u201cnovel\u201d form of collection, but nevertheless deferred to \u201cthe fully considered judgment of the executive branch in assessing and responding to national security threats and in determining the potential significance of intelligence-related information.\u201d This opinion\u2014called \u201cstrange\u201d and a \u201chead-scratcher\u201d\u2014later served as precedent upon which FISA Judge Claire Eagan relied in her 2006 authorization of the bulk phone records collection.\n\nTime and again, the FISC accepts the Administration\u2019s shockingly flimsy arguments. As a set, the few public FISC opinions we\u2019ve seen suggest that the Executive Branch\u2014in cahoots with a few selected judges\u2014has replaced legitimate public statutes with secret, illegitimate common law.\n\nThe rule of law is a basic democratic principle meaning that all members of a society\u2014individuals, organizations, and government officials\u2014must obey publicly disclosed legal codes and processes. If Cole is right that, try as it might, Congress cannot end bulk collection because the secret FISA court may defer to the NSA\u2019s interpretation of the rules, there is no rule of law. The NSA is in charge, the FISA court process is just a fig leaf, and this is no longer a democracy. There\u2019s been a coup d\u2019etat.",

                "text": "Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Corn Exchange to tell Nigel Farage that Edinburgh would not stand for his brand of politics.\n\nPeople of all ages and of a variety of political persuasions brandished placards against Ukip policy as Mr Farage launched the Scottish leg of his European election campaign inside the Chesser venue.\n\nMomentum had been gathering since the controversial leader\u2019s last visit to the Capital a year ago, when he was forced to lock himself inside the Canons\u2019 Gait pub on the Royal Mile to avoid an angry mob outside before being escorted away in a police van.\n\nDespite the far-right group Britain First promising to use armoured vehicles to \u201cprotect\u201d Mr Farage last night, the handful of members who did turn up were warned off by protesters, with chants of \u201cNazi scum, get off our streets\u201d.\n\nA heavy police presence made sure that the small group of far-right supporters was separated from the 300-strong anti-Ukip protesters, and the demonstration was generally peaceful.\n\nCampaigners gathered round to hear speeches from the likes of the Green Party\u2019s lead European election candidate, city councillor Maggie Chapman.\n\nShe attracted loud cheers when she said: \u201cThere is no Ukip representation in politics in Scotland. Let\u2019s keep it that way.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the Evening News afterwards, Cllr Chapman said: \u201cOne of the best things about this event is its diversity.\n\n\u201cWe have people who are very committed members of different political parties, and people who have shunned party politics.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, John McArdle, of disability rights group the Black Triangle, said: \u201cUkip is deceiving the British people by saying that all the problems are caused by the immigrants. It\u2019s not the case.\n\n\u201cWe are absolutely not anti-English \u2013 the whole point is to say that Scotland welcomes refugees and immigrants.\n\n\u201cWe oppose scapegoating for the financial crisis, and disabled people have been scapegoated and subjected to \u00a328 billion of cuts.\u201d\n\nScottish Socialist party joint national spokesman Colin Fox had his speech cut short when his audience broke off to target far-right campaigners.\n\nBut Mr Fox said he was pleased with the turnout and claimed the overall message was positive.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the guy [Mr Farage] that\u2019s the merchant banker coming to Scotland and blaming immigrants for the banking crisis,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said if Ukip topped the polls south of the Border in the European vote later this month, it would boost the Scottish independence campaign by showing it \u201cwasn\u2019t two different countries, but two different worlds\u201d.\n\nThe vocal protesters also sang along to a range of carefully chosen songs broadcast on a PA, including I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor, Smells Like Teen Spirit by Nirvana and the Village People\u2019s YMCA.\n\nPeople of all walks of life were among the crowd, which was a sea of placards with messages including \u201cDon\u2019t be used by Ukip\u201d and \u201cNo to Ukip\u2019s racist lies\u201d.\n\nAmong the protesters was Vonny Moyes, 26, who was carrying a sign which read: \u201cScotland rejects all racism, misogyny, homophobia and inequality. Say no to Ukip and Yes to a better future, today.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Isaac Jack, 39, said: \u201cI\u2019m neither for nor against independence, but I\u2019m here on an anti-racist basis.\u201d\n\nChris Newlove, 27, of the Stand Up Against Ukip group, which helped organise the protest alongside the Radical Independence Campaign (RIC), said: \u201cWe believe Ukip is a racist party. I think today has gone really well.\n\n\u201cThe turnout is really good. From the people I have spoken to, the main issue is that the party is scapegoating.\u201d\n\nAn RIC spokesman said: \u201cThe real story here is that Ukip haven\u2019t been able to come here unopposed. Immigration isn\u2019t the problem.\n\n\u201cUkip are covering up for the establishment by hiding behind immigration.\u201d\n\nAs Mr Farage sneaked out the Corn Exchange \u2013 a former slaughterhouse \u2013 through the back door, his 50 or so supporters faced a barrage of heckling as they trickled out of the front entrance.\n\nProtesters repeatedly yelled \u201cscum\u201d and \u201cshame on you\u201d at the Ukip members \u2013 some of them in their 70s and 80s \u2013 as police kept a watchful eye.\n\nNIGEL Farage\u2019s UK Independence Party won a tiny 0.91 per cent of the regional vote across Scotland in the 2011 Holyrood elections.\n\nThe party north of the Border has experienced nothing like the surge it has seen in England, where it has the Tories running scared.\n\nYet Mr Farage knew his visit to Edinburgh to address a European election rally was guaranteed to get widespread media coverage.\n\nHis last appearance in the Capital hit the headlines when he had to lock himself inside the Canons\u2019 Gait pub in the Royal Mile, right, before police escorted him away as protesters chanted outside.\n\nHe later described the demonstrators as \u201cdeeply racist with a total hatred of the English\u201d and hung up the phone during a radio interview, accusing the BBC presenter of \u201chatred\u201d as well.\n\nTwelve months on and having enjoyed plenty more publicity, Mr Farage returned to the Capital for last night\u2019s members-only rally at the Corn Exchange.\n\nThere was supposed to be a press conference at 5pm and all the media turned up, but rather than deal with journalists en masse, Mr Farage opted to do interviews with a few at a time, giving priority to some of the more right-wing titles.\n\nThe Evening News was left till last.\n\nAsked about the hundreds of people demonstrating outside, he said the protest was \u201cbigger and more organised\u201d than last year. But he added: \u201cClearly people like to hate someone, but the things they are accusing us of are so wide of the mark they have picked completely the wrong target.\u201d\n\nDespite the broad spectrum represented among the protesting crowd, Mr Farage seemed to see them mostly as nationalists of one brand or another \u2013 prompting what might be seen as the rather ironic comment: \u201cA little bit of nationalism is a very good thing in life and very healthy but too much nationalism engenders and breeds something deeply unpleasant.\u201d\n\nLooking to the May 22 European elections, Mr Farage insisted the underlying level of Euroscepticsm in Scotland was not that different from south of the border \u2013 it just needed a voice.\n\nHe claimed Ukip was \u201con course\u201d to win one seat \u2013 possibly even two.",

The First Minister said: \u201cNigel Farage and his party will not be defeated by demonstrations, which only give him the chance to play the victim, but by being humiliated at the ballot box, as they have been many times before in Scotland.\u201d Mr Farage, whose party has no elected representatives in Scotland, was supporting Ukip Euro candidate David Coburn.

                "text": "KANSAS CITY, Kan. -- Welcome to the bizarro world of night racing at Kansas Speedway.\n\nThe track's first Cup race under the lights produced some peculiar moments. The start was delayed by 35 minutes due to passing thunderstorms and reports of tornadoes in the area. Just shy of the halfway mark, the bank of lights lining the outside of the backstretch went dark.\n\nWith 116 laps to go, Jamie McMurray inexplicably crunched the Turn 3 wall in his No. 1 McDonald's Chevrolet and had to be rescued from the burning wreckage by crew members on pit road.\n\nWith 80 to go, AJ Allmendinger got loose on the frontstretch and triggered a nasty six-car wreck that ended with David Gilliland and Justin Allgaier wobbling away from mangled heaps of metal.\n\nOh, and Danica Patrick made a bold double pass of Tony Stewart and Dale Earnhardt Jr. to run third deep into the race. She finished a career-best seventh.\n\nIt had to be Jeff Gordon celebrating his 89th career victory and his first of 2014. The four-time Sprint Cup champion said recently he would gladly trade his points lead for a win. After prevailing in the 5-hour Energy 400, he won't have to.\n\nGordon became the ninth different winner in 11 races this season, all but locking down a Chase spot under NASCAR's new playoff-clinching format that rewards winning. It was Gordon's third trip to Victory Lane at Kansas -- he won the first two Cup races here, in 2001 and '02.\n\n\"This is so sweet,\" a jubilant Gordon told a Fox reporter afterward. \"What a huge weight lifted off this team's shoulders.\"\n\nIt wasn't easy. Gordon inherited the lead with eight laps to go when Brad Keselowski pitted for fuel, then he had to hold off a determined Kevin Harvick on a wild final lap to take the checkers.\n\n\"He was strong and he was coming ...\" Gordon said of Harvick. \"I'm not sure I could have held him off much longer.\"\n\nKasey Kahne finished third, followed by Joey Logano and Earnhardt.\n\nHarvick clearly had the car to beat early and late. The pole-sitter had a third of the field lapped before pitting for fuel on Lap 42. Inevitably, an ill-timed pit stop that mired him in the middle of the pack for much of the race and a mental mistake on pit road down the stretch cost Harvick the chance to win his third Cup race of 2014.\n\n\"The car was really fast,\" said Harvick, who led a race-high 119 laps. \"We just had to overcome a lot tonight. Getting caught on pit road both times under green-flag pit stops and then we ran out of gas coming to pit road there. I was looking at the fuel-pressure gauge instead of the tach[ometer] and lost a bunch of time down pit road and off of pit road and wound up getting stuck behind the 24 ...\n\n\"I just ran out of laps at the end. ... I made too many mistakes at the end to get by him.\"\n\nGordon will take it. He's been consistent all season, entering the race with four top-5s in 10 starts (he had eight all of last season).\n\nHow special was this victory? Gordon was downright giddy when he met with reporters afterward.\n\n\"It's very cool,\" he said. \"This has always been one of my favorite tracks, from that first race [in 2001]. I don't know what it is about this race team and this racetrack for inaugural events, but tonight's win was very, very special. And it didn't come easy. ...\n\n\"Nothing makes me more proud than when it's all on the line and you get the lead and you have to hold off someone like Harvick and you get it done. It may have been by inches, but we got it done. That's what builds momentum. That's what builds a great race team and turns you not only into a winning team but hopefully into a championship team.\"\n\nGordon's quest for a fifth championship improved greatly Saturday night. With a victory in his pocket -- and a Chase berth all but secure -- he and the 24 crew are in position to be more aggressive, an approach Hendrick Motorsports teammate Earnhardt adopted following his season-opening win at Daytona.\n\n\"Getting that first win is so crucial,\" Gordon said. \"It's not a guarantee [for the Chase], but it's almost a guarantee. Once you get that first win, it can only lead you to the ability to take risks to get the next win.\"",

                "text": "KANSAS CITY, Kan. The Sprint Cup Series points leader is now also a winner.\n\nJeff Gordon held off a furious last-lap challenge from Kevin Harvick to win Saturday night\u2019s 5-Hour Energy 400 at Kansas Speedway, his first victory of the 2014 season and 89th of his career.\n\nGordon is the ninth winner in the first 11 races of the season. The win is his third at Kansas, the most of any driver.\n\nKasey Kahne finished third, Joey Logano fourth and Dale Earnhardt Jr. fifth. Danica Patrick finished seventh, a career-best.\n\nThe start of the race was delayed about 30 minutes by a severe thunderstorm in the area of the race track which arrived right near the start.\n\nOnce the race began, Harvick, the pole-winner, took early control, leading the first 41 laps.\n\nA round of green-flag pit stops began on Lap 41 but before they were completed, Clint Bowyer spun, which brought out a caution on Lap 48.\n\nAfter a round of pit stops, Brad Keselowski took the lead on the restart on Lap 53 but was quickly overtaken by Harvick.\n\nA four-car wreck involving Michael Annett, David Ragan, Landon Cassill and Ryan Truex brought out the race\u2019s second caution on Lap 61. A handful of lead-lap cars pitted for tires and fuel, but Harvick continued to lead on the restart on Lap 67.\n\nDenny Hamlin took a solo spin on Lap 71 to bring out the third caution. Again, a handful of lead-lap cars made pit stops and Harvick remained out front on Lap 75.\n\nAnother round of green-flag pit stops on Lap 102 but once again they were interrupted by a caution when Marcos Ambrose spun on Lap 110.\n\nDuring the caution, Kyle Busch was penalized for speeding on pit road, and Jimmie Johnson reported he was having problems with the clutch. After teams completed pit stops, a row of backstretch lights lost power, but NASCAR checked with drivers and elected to continue racing.\n\nOn the restart on Lap 161, Earnhardt took the lead followed by Kahne and Logano.\n\nLogano moved into the lead on Lap 122, and Kahne took the lead for the first time on Lap 140.\n\nOn Lap 151, Jamie McMurray slammed into the wall and his car caught fire from a break in his oil line. McMurray was not injured.\n\n\u201cI just entered Turn 3 and I heard a small pop and then just lost all the steering and got into the fence and then knocked the oil lines and everything off which caused the fire,\u201d McMurray said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, we didn\u2019t really have any tire issues all weekend.\u201d\n\nOn the restart on Lap 161, Kahne led the way followed by Tony Stewart and Hamlin.\n\nKurt Busch spun to bring out the sixth caution of the race on Lap 180. Johnson and Kyle Busch elected not to pit and took over the first and second positions, respectively, on the restart on Lap 185. They were followed by Logano, Kahne and Earnhardt.\n\nA.J. Allmendinger got loose and spun on Lap 187 in an incident that also collected Casey Mears, Justin Allgaier and David Gilliland. Gilliland\u2019s car took the biggest hit, and he walked gingerly from his car to the ambulance.\n\n\u201cThat is one of the hardest hits I have had in awhile. Hopefully it will be the hardest one for awhile to come, too,\u201d he said. \u201cI am fine, though, just ready to get on with it.\u201d\n\nSeveral lead-lap cars elected to pit under the caution. On the restart on Lap 195, Johnson led followed by Logano, Kyle Busch and Harvick. Logano quickly moved into the lead after the restart.\n\nKurt Busch again spun on Lap 203 to bring out the eighth caution. On the restart on Lap 208, Logano led followed by Harvick and Earnhardt.\n\nTeams began making their final green-flag pit stops of the race on Lap 236.\n\nWith 10 laps remaining, Keselowski held the lead but still required another pit stop. Gordon was in second, followed by Harvick.\n\nOne lap later, Keselowski pitted and Gordon inherited the lead.",
