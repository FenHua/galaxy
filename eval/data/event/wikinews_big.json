The scope of Bush administration abuse appears far broader than previously acknowledged and underscores the importance of opening up a full-scale inquiry into what happened.\n\n(Washington) – The government during the Bush administration tortured opponents of Muammar Gaddafi, then transferred them to mistreatment in , according to accounts by former detainees and recently uncovered CIA and UK Secret Service documents, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. One former detainee alleged he was waterboarded and another described a similar form of water torture, contradicting claims by Bush administration officials that only three men in US custody had been waterboarded.\n\nThe 154-page report, “Delivered into Enemy Hands: US-Led Abuse and Rendition of Opponents to Gaddafi’s Libya,” is based on interviews conducted in Libya with 14 former detainees, most of whom belonged to an armed Islamist group that had worked to overthrow Gaddafi for 20 years. Many members of the group, the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), joined the NATO-backed anti-Gaddafi rebels in the 2011 conflict. Some of those who were rendered and allegedly tortured in US custody now hold key leadership and political positions in the country.\n\n“Not only did the US deliver Gaddafi his enemies on a silver platter but it seems the CIA tortured many of them first,” said , counterterrorism advisor at Human Rights Watch and author of the report. “The scope of Bush administration abuse appears far broader than previously acknowledged and underscores the importance of opening up a full-scale inquiry into what happened.”\n\nThe report is also based on documents – some of which are being made public for the first time – that Human Rights Watch found abandoned, on September 3, 2011, in the offices of former Libyan intelligence chief Musa Kusa after Tripoli fell to rebel forces.\n\nThe interviews and documents establish that, following the September 11, 2001 attacks, the US, with aid from the (UK) and countries in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, arrested and held without charge a number of LIFG members living outside Libya, and eventually rendered them to the Libyan government.\n\nThe report also describes serious abuses that five of the former LIFG members said they experienced at two US-run detention facilities in Afghanistan, most likely operated by the CIA. They include new allegations of waterboarding and other water torture. The details are consistent with the few other first-hand accounts about the same US-run facilities.\n\nOther abuses reported by these former detainees include being chained to walls naked –sometimes while diapered – in pitch black, windowless cells, for weeks or months; restrained in painful stress positions for long periods, forced into cramped spaces; beaten and slammed into walls; kept indoors for nearly five months without the ability to bathe; and denied sleep by continuous, very loud Western music.\n\n“I spent three months getting interrogated heavily during the first period and they gave me a different type of torture every day. Sometimes they used water, sometimes not.… Sometimes they stripped me naked and sometimes they left me clothed,” said Khalid al-Sharif, who asserted he was held for two years in two different US-run detention centers believed to be operated by the CIA in Afghanistan. Al-Sharif is now head of the Libyan National Guard. One of his responsibilities is providing security for facilities holding Libya’s high-value detainees.\n\nThe Libyan detainee accounts in the Human Rights Watch report had previously gone largely undocumented because most of those returned to Libya were locked up in Libyan prisons until last year, when Libya’s civil unrest led to their release. And the US government has been unwilling to make public the details about its secret CIA detention facilities. The accounts of former detainees, the CIA documents found in Libya, and some declassified US government memos have shed new light on US detention practices under the Bush administration but also highlighted the vast amount of information that still remains secret.\n\nDespite overwhelming evidence of numerous and systematic abuses of detainees in US custody since the September 11 attacks, the US has yet to hold a single senior official accountable. Only a few low-ranking enlisted military personnel have been punished.\n\nOn August 30, 2012, US Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the only criminal investigation the Department of Justice had undertaken into alleged abuses in CIA custody, headed by special prosecutor John Durham, would be closed without anyone being criminally charged. Holder had already narrowed the scope of Durham’s investigation on June 30, 2011, limiting it from the original investigation into the 101 people believed to have been in CIA custody to the cases of only two individuals.\n\nIn both cases, the detainees had died, one in and another in . The inquiry was also limited in that it looked only into abuses that went beyond what the Bush administration had authorized. It could not cover acts of torture, such as waterboarding, and other ill-treatment that Bush administration lawyers had approved, even if the acts violated domestic and international law.\n\n“The stories of the Libyans held by the US and then sent to Libya make clear that detainee abuse, including mistreatment not necessarily specifically authorized by Bush administration officials, was far-reaching,” Pitter said. “The closure of the Durham investigation, without any charges, sends a message that abuse like that suffered by the Libyan detainees will continue to be tolerated.”\n\nThe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) has spent three years researching the CIA’s detention and interrogation program and is nearing completion of a report. Human Rights Watch called on the SSCI to promptly release its report upon completion with as few redactions as possible, and to recommend that an independent, non-partisan commission investigate all aspects of US policy relating to detainee treatment.\n\n“The US government continues to demand, and rightly so, that countries from Libya to Syria to Bahrain hold accountable officials responsible for serious human rights abuses, including torture,” Pitter said. “Those calls would carry a lot more weight if it wasn’t simultaneously shielding former US officials who authorized torture from any form of accountability.”\n\nSince the fall of the Gaddafi government, US diplomats and members of Congress have met with some of the former CIA prisoners now in Libya, and the US has supported efforts by the Libyan government and civil society to overcome the legacy of their country’s authoritarian past. Human Rights Watch urged the US government to acknowledge its own past role in abuses and in helping Gaddafi round up his exiled opponents, to provide redress to the victims, and to prosecute those responsible for their alleged torture in US custody.\n\nOne previously reported case for which Human Rights Watch uncovered some new information is that of Ibn al-Sheikh al-Libi. The Bush administration had helped to justify the 2003 Iraq invasion by relying on statements that al-Libi made during his abuse and mistreatment in CIA custody. The CIA has acknowledged that these statements were unreliable. Years later, the US rendered al-Libi to Libya, where he died in prison in May 2009. Accounts from al-Libi’s fellow detainees in Afghanistan and Libya, information from his family, and photos seen by Human Rights Watch apparently taken of him the day he died, provide insight into his treatment and death, which Libyan authorities claim was a suicide.\n\nScores of the documents that Human Rights Watch uncovered in Libya also show a high level of cooperation between the Gaddafi government in Libya and US and the UK in the renditions discussed in the report.\n\nThe US played the most extensive role in the renditions back to Libya. But other countries, notably the UK, were also involved, even though these governments knew and recognized that torture was common during Gaddafi’s rule. Countries linked to the accounts about renditions include: Afghanistan, , and Hong Kong, , , Mauritania, , , , , , and the UK. Interviewees alleged that personnel in some of these countries also abused them prior to transferring them back to Libya.\n\nInternational law binding on the US and other countries prohibits torture and other ill-treatment in all circumstances, and forbids transferring people to countries in which they face a serious risk of torture or persecution.\n\n“The involvement of many countries in the abuse of Gaddafi’s enemies suggests that the tentacles of the US detention and interrogation program reached far beyond what was previously known,” Pitter said. “The US and other governments that assisted in detainee abuse should offer a full accounting of their role.”\n\n*A previous version of this press release incorrectly stated that the SSCI had completed its report.

Bush and his administration that only three terror suspects, none of whom were Libyan, were waterboarded during interrogations.\n\nHuman rights groups consider waterboarding -- in which a prisoner is restrained and water poured over his mouth and nose to produce the sensation of drowning -- a form of torture.\n\n\"While never using the phrase 'waterboarding,' he said that after his captors put a hood over his head and strapped him onto a wooden board, 'then they start with the water pouring. ... They start to pour water to the point where you feel like you are suffocating.' He added that 'they wouldn't stop until they got some kind of answer from me,'\" the report said.\n\nLaura Pitter, a counterterrorism adviser for Human Rights Watch and the author of the report, said abuses occurred in U.S.-run facilities in Afghanistan between April 2003 and April 2005. She said waterboarding occurred in 2003 but it is not clear if it occurred afterward.\n\nThe rights group's accusations come a week after the U.S. Justice Department closed a criminal investigation without charges into the deaths of two terror suspects in CIA custody.\n\nCIA spokeswoman Jennifer Youngblood said she couldn't comment on the report's \"specific allegations\" but said the CIA has been on record about \"three substantiated cases in which detainees were subjected to the waterboarding technique.\"\n\n\"The Department of Justice has exhaustively reviewed the treatment of more than 100 detainees in the post-9/11 period -- including allegations involving unauthorized interrogation techniques -- and it declined prosecution in every case,\" she said.\n\nAmong those who officials have acknowledged were subjected to waterboarding was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, described as the principal architect of the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request by CNN for comment on the allegations.\n\nCNN is unable to independently corroborate the claims by Human Rights Watch.\n\nJoseph Wippl, a 30-year CIA operations officer and director of graduate studies at Boston University's Department of International Relations, said these kinds of \"allegations\" have been probed \"countless times.\"\n\n\"If further facts are established,\" he said, another investigation \"to get at the truth\" will occur.\n\nWippl said \"accusations of torture are a part of the propaganda war\" against the United States. He stressed that \"lengthy\" congressional probes into waterboarding identified only three people who had been victims of the practice.\n\n\"Either the Libyan victims are making up the story, embellishing the story, or have come up with some facts that are new,\" Wippl said. \"There could have been renegade interrogations.\"\n\nThe Human Rights Watch report cites repeated allegations of torture by the detainees while in the custody of the United States and other countries: being chained to a wall naked, forced into cramped positions, restrained in painful positions for long periods and undergoing repeated beatings. Al-Shoroeiya and another detainee, Khalid al-Sharif, also underwent water torture similar to waterboarding, the report said.\n\n\"The scope of Bush administration abuse appears far broader than previously acknowledged and underscores the importance of opening up a full-scale inquiry into what happened,\" Pitter said.\n\nHer report is titled \"Delivered into Enemy Hands: US-Led Abuse and Rendition of Opponents to (Gadhafi's) Libya.\"\n\nThe report also largely relies on Human Rights Watch interviews with former detainees, many of whom claim to have been members of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, which was working to overthrow Gadhafi in the early 1980s.\n\nIt cites accounts of 14 former detainees and what it describes as \"recently uncovered CIA and UK Secret Service documents\" found in the sacked offices of Libya's former intelligence chief as proof of the torture and mistreatment.\n\n\"The interviews and documents establish that, following the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S., with aid from the United Kingdom and countries in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia arrested and held without charge a number\" of LIFG members, Human Rights Watch said.\n\nThey were \"rendered\" to Libya, mostly between 2004 and 2006, when \"the United States and the United Kingdom were trying to transform\" Gadhafi \"from foe to ally\" during their rapprochement with the dictator.\n\nMost members of the LIFG had fled Libya by the end of the 1980s and set up operations in Afghanistan. A number of the detainees were picked up in Afghanistan, according to the report.\n\nDetainees claimed to have been turned over to Gadhafi and then jailed. Some of the detainees claimed torture at the hands of Gadhafi's jailers, while other said they were not mistreated.\n\n\"All interviewees said their captors forcibly returned them to Libya at a time when Libya's record on torture made clear they would face a serious risk of abuse upon return. All had expressed deep fears to their captors about going back to Libya and five of them said that they specifically asked for asylum,\" the report said.\n\nTerror analysts say that by at least 2004, some members of the group had aligned themselves with al Qaeda, though many former members say the LIFG had nothing to do with the terror group. The United States classified the LIFG as a terror organization in late 2004.\n\nMany of the detainees, according to the report, were freed during Libya's civil war and fought alongside the rebels.\n\n\"Some of those who were rendered and allegedly tortured in U.S. custody now hold key leadership and political positions in the country,\" the report said.\n\nThe documents were found by Human Rights Watch researchers on September 3, 2011, in the offices of former Libyan intelligence chief Moussa Koussa. In late August 2011, Tripoli fell to rebel forces that were backed by NATO. Gadhafi was captured and killed by rebels in October 2011.\n\nOne of the documents -- a fax -- offers to help Libya pay for an airplane to pick up a prisoner, while a communiqué from a British intelligence officer to Koussa offers congratulations to Libya over its jailing of another former detainee handed over by the UK.\n\n\"The report makes clear there's so much that we don't know about what happens in these places,\" Pitter said. \"This is the tip of the iceberg.\"\n\nShe said the actions occurred during the Bush administration but are now the legacy of President Obama. She said the United States must make clear these actions should never happen again.\n\n\"The one thing we're hoping the report does make clear is it's important for the United States to look back and acknowledge mistakes were made,\" she said.\n\nTime: Did Britain approve the illegal rendition, torture of Libyans?", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:52:08.789-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:52:08.789-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://blogs.voanews.com/breaking-news/2012/09/06/rights-group-alleges-more-waterboarding-by-us-2/", "title" : "Rights Group Alleges More Waterboarding By US « VOA Breaking News", "text" : "A human rights group says it has uncovered new evidence that U.S. personnel used torture, including waterboarding, while interrogating Libyan Islamists during the Bush administration.\n\nThe report released Thursday by the New York-based Human Rights Watch features interviews with 14 Libyan dissidents captured and detained in foreign countries, including Afghanistan.\n\nHuman Rights Watch says the Islamists were tortured before American agents handed them over “on a silver platter” to then-Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.

He was 71.\n\nWhile the condolence messages started to pour in almost as soon as the news of Ghafoor’s demise spread, it was noted with regret that Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) President Faisal Saleh Hayat had failed to come forward for the help of the ailing player during his hour of need.\n\nPopularly known as ‘Majna’ which means ‘I will hit you’ in local lingo, Ghafoor was nicknamed the ‘Pakistani Pele’ during his playing days for his remarkable resemblance to the Brazilian football legend.\n\nWhen the real Pele in Brazil heard about his look-alike in Pakistan who also played football, he expressed his desire to meet Ghafoor but the two never met.\n\nGhafoor, although he was an all-rounder, mostly played in the midfield. He was captain of the Pakistan football team for four consecutive years in the 1960s when the country had a football identity and the country’s players were in demand in the foreign clubs.\n\nGhafoor, a member of the famous Dhaka Mohammedan Club in the former East Pakistan, too, had many offers to play for clubs in many countries including India, Russia, Saudi Arabia and China, but he turned them down and preferred to play in his country and for his country.\n\nUnder Abdul Ghafoor’s captaincy, the Pakistan team beat the national teams of UAE and China. On the national level, he was a member of the Karachi Port Trust department team. After the fall of Dhaka, several players from Lyari district in Karachi were taken on by Dhaka Mohammedan on Ghafoor’s recommendation.\n\nSix years ago the football authorities in Bangladesh contacted him again to suggest some players from Pakistan to play in their league. Unfortunately, their letter never reached Abdul Ghafoor as it was sent to the PFF because the Bangladeshis believed that a player of such great caliber as Ghafoor would be running the affairs of football in Pakistan. The PFF, instead of forwarding the letter to Ghafoor, sent its own team of boys to Bangladesh.\n\nFive years ago, he suffered a brain hemorrhage and had been paralysed ever since. When his treatment costs became unbearable for his family, his son Abdul Ghani quietly spread the word that they would appreciate some financial help.\n\n“I cannot tell my father about this as he is a very proud man who will die from embarrassment on learning that we are willing to accept charity on his behalf. But he is bedridden and his pension cannot cover his medical expenses when just one pill costs Rs 120,” his son had said soon after Sindh Sports Minister Dr Mohammad Ali announced help for him on the Sindh Assembly floor in January this year.\n\nPresident PFF, Makhdoom Syed Faisal Saleh Hayat in his condolence message said: “I was deeply saddened by the death of Pakistani Pele. This must be very difficult for all football lovers and players. Abdul Ghafoor was a kind person who will be greatly missed by all who knew him.\n\n“I will remember his contribution for the development of football in Pakistan. The loss to football is irreparable, and it will be very difficult to fill the vacuum created by the passing away of such a great soccer star of Pakistan at this moment.

No matter how many times we see it, we tear up at the sight of George Bailey's friends coming to his aid in his time of need, proving to him that he really is the richest man in town.\n\nOver the last couple of days, we watched something remarkable happen as the readers of this blog rallied to help a family in a somewhat similar circumstance. Only this time it wasn't old man Potter providing the bullying tactics, but the attorneys of the Church of Scientology.\n\nAs we reported on Thursday, Marc and Claire Headley were stunned when the church -- their former employer -- offered to waive the $42,852.06 in court costs they owed if the couple agreed to spy on former church executive Marty Rathbun and other critics of Scientology, including \"media contacts.\" (We can imagine a short list of who that might include.)\n\nAs Claire explained it to the Tampa Bay Times in a story that came out later that night, \"I'm like, over my dead body. ... I'll sell my child's backpack if have to.''\n\nAnd they almost had to go that far, selling the van that Marc used for his audio/visual design business, cashing out their savings, and even selling their kids' swing set. (They have two children, and Claire is pregnant with a third.) They also had to borrow $6,000 in order to come up with the complete amount, which they paid on August 31.\n\nJason Beghe, the actor who loudly quit Scientology several years ago, told me that he spent considerable time convincing the Headleys that other people who had left Scientology or had enjoyed Marc's book about their experiences, Blown For Good, would want to help out the couple. Start a fund, he urged Marc, and Thursday, Headley did just that.\n\nIn our story on Thursday, we published the bullying letter from the church, as well as a link to Headley's fundraising site.\n\nThe response -- well, it was obvious from our comments section that our readers were surprised and overwhelmed by what unfolded. As were the Headleys.\n\nWithin 24 hours, more than $27,000 had been raised by Village Voice readers and the readers of Marty Rathbun's blog.\n\nAs of this morning, the total has reached $35,317.00 from 413 different donations, many of them only $10 or $20.\n\nWe've listed all of those of $100 or more here, and we've borrowed some language from Scientology's own fundraising jargon, just for fun...\n\nPatron ($100) -- Alanzo, Liz & James Anderson, Karola Andris, Anonymous (20), Bela, Terry Brawley, Mark Bunker, Cajunette, Carolyn, Colwell, Conrad, Steve Cook, Jacob Dickerman, DMSTCC, Brian Eckert, Ziba & Jim Feulner, Eamonn Fitzgerald, Luis & Rocio Garcia, Dan Garvin, Happy to Help, Jeff Henninger, Bruce Hines, Deana Holmes, Ted Horner, Jackson, Jan, Jenna & Dallas, Jeanne, Janet Kay, Yuliya Keaton, Naula Kelly, Peggy Lauroff-Tourangeau, Lois & Clark, Joe Lynn, The Matlocks, Melinda, Suzanna Nielsen, Lisa O'Kane, Frank Oliver, The Oracle, Martin Padfield, Sinar Parman, Skip Press, Roger from Switzerland, Anna Schultz, Amy Scobee and Mat Pesch, Ervin Scott, Roy Selby, Ms. Smith, Peter Smith, Barbara Snow, Big Stevie, Laurisse Stuckenbrick, Jens Tingleff, Ora Walker, WhereisSHE, Marta & Larry Willson, Astra & Lawrence Woodcraft\n\n\n\nSome of the smaller donations were also noteworthy for the messages they contained.\n\nXenu, $10.00: \"Sorry it couldn't be more but I'm still paying off those DC-8s.\"\n\nL.

Maybe they will invite me to swing on it some day.\"\n\nMany more have left humorous notes -- but with real cash attached.\n\nLate last night, Claire added a message to the fundraising page.\n\n\"I think I have shed more tears these last few days than I can remember... Not sad tears, but the tears that come automatically when you see incredible acts of kindness,\" she wrote.\n\nShe said that their three years of litigation had been tough.\n\n\"I sought therapy after being grilled by Scientology lawyers on the subject of forced abortions, simply because I could not stop crying,\" she wrote.\n\nBut now, she can make those depositions public. And we look forward to reading them.\n\n\"I will remain forever changed by this,\" Claire wrote. \"I may have lost some faith in the legal system, but ultimately I have gained a whole new view of the power of love and humanity.\"\n\nABC Once Again Delays Broadcast of a Scientology Story\n\n\n\n In 2008, Jason Beghe flew to New York after news broke online that he'd left Scientology. I met him at a restaurant here, and he told me that he'd just spent several hours being interviewed by Elizabeth Vargas for ABC's program 20/20. He'd told her very detailed information about his time in Scientology and why he'd decided to leave.\n\nNone of that material ever aired.\n\nThat memory came back to me recently when I had my own experience being interviewed by Elizabeth Vargas and a producer for 20/20 for two hours after the news of the Tom Cruise/Katie Holmes divorce had broken. I was one of about a dozen people interviewed for what we were told would be a full hour on Scientology -- four separate segments dealing with Cruise and Holmes, children in the church, Scientology leader David Miscavige, and the abuses of the Sea Org.\n\nOn Monday of the week that special was scheduled to air, just 11 days after news of the split had first broken, Cruise and Holmes reached an agreement that would settle their divorce.\n\nThe next day, we were told that the show had been \"postponed.\" Two separate ABC producers told me the purpose of the delay was just to take more time to put the show together -- with the divorce settlement done and some of the immediacy gone, 20/20 wanted to be methodical and not rush things.\n\nBut just before they told me that, ABC producers had been pestering me with follow-up questions which showed they were getting heat from their own attorneys. I had said in my interview, for example, that Scientology was known for violating the supposed confidentiality of confessional \"auditing\" sessions that church members go through (when Scientologists run afoul of the organization, they find that things they admitted to supposedly under the strictest secrecy would suddenly show up in slimy anonymous attack websites, for example). Sounding a bit panicked, ABC's producers wanted to know how I could back up that statement. With literally decades of court documents, I said. That seemed to calm them down. But then they postponed the show, saying they just wanted to take their time.\n\nAnother reason to doubt that assertion, however, came from two other people who had been contacted to be interviewed for the show. Both were scheduled to be flown to New York that week, and then were suddenly told their trips had been cancelled. If ABC had just wanted more time to edit or vet their upcoming special, why would they cancel those interviews, both of them with key former Scientologists?\n\nOver the past several weeks, I gave ABC the benefit of the doubt as they sat on what was reportedly amazing material. (They interviewed the Headleys, for example, and I'm told that Claire's harrowing tales -- including the two abortions she was forced to endure as a Sea Org member -- had the entire film crew at her house openly weeping.)\n\nThen, Friday night, ABC caved again, and this time much more publicly.\n\nHere's what I mean. This is a screenshot from my cable television system that night, showing what was scheduled to appear on that night's edition of 20/20...\n\n\n\n Not only was an interview with Orth prepared for the show, the Headleys had also been hastily re-interviewed for what they were told would be segments on both 20/20 and Nightline -- but nothing about Scientology showed up on either of those two programs Friday night.\n\nInstead, 20/20 was on air for two hours that night, and with the Orth interview spiked, the show's producers clearly had to pull out some musty evergreens to fill all that time -- your house cat, they proved, is actually a predator, and people video themselves doing the darndest things these days.\n\nWhat's going on? Well, we can only imagine that Scientology is hitting ABC with around-the-clock heat from its attorneys. And you can see for yourself what that's like. For some unfathomable reason, on Wednesday, the church made public on one of its websites several letters that it sent to Vanity Fair in an attempt to intimidate editor Graydon Carter and writer Maureen Orth from publishing her story on Tom Cruise and Nazanin Boniadi.\n\nThe most unhinged of these is from church attorney Jeffrey Riffer to Carter. Riffer not only hyperventilates about the sanctity of David Miscavige, he also makes the most bizarre sort of taunt to Carter, asking the editor why he didn't require Orth to work with a Vanity Fair employee who also \"works for Mr. Miscavige in a professional activity.\"\n\nSay what? Wednesday evening I e-mailed Riffer, asking him about this, but he hasn't responded. I wondered if he was referring to a Vanity Fair writer who former church executives Marty Rathbun and Mike Rinder claimed has been on the Scientology payroll for years. But both Rathbun and Rinder tell me they think Riffer is not referring to that writer in this letter. (I hear that Riffer is apparently talking about a freelance photographer who has shot some of Miscavige's ribbon-cutting ceremonies.)\n\nAnyway, reading Riffer's letter should give you some sense of the kind of bullying that ABC is going through right now.\n\nBut here's the thing. That kind of intimidation didn't stop Graydon Carter, Maureen Orth, and Vanity Fair. It also hasn't stopped NBC, whose Rock Center program has aired two significant pieces recently about Scientology -- one about Rathbun and Rinder, another about the Narconon mess in Oklahoma. And we hear they're hard at work on a third piece, about \"The Hole.\"\n\nWe'd hate to think the entertainment division is keeping the news division from growing a pair.\n\nAs for what Scientology's war with the media is like from the other side, there's this classic description of the church's stall tactics against CNN as described by Rathbun and Rinder in a video they made last year. We imagine ABC is being put through something similar right now...\n\n\n\nOn the next page: Our countdown, Sunday Funnies, and Hubbard at sea!", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:52:29.725-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:52:29.725-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.gofundme.com/15lfi4", "title" : "Headley Family Legal Fund by Marc Headley", "text" : "In 2005 my wife and I fled the compound where we had worked for Scientology for many years. After getting out and starting our lives over, we realized that what went on there was not only wrong but that no one was doing anything effective to expose and stop it.\n\nWhile we were exhilarated to finally be free, and excited to start our lives over with nothing, we also felt a moral obligation to do something about the abuses we knew were being committed on a daily basis behind Scientology's glossy façade.\n\nIn 2006 I (Marc) started posting what I knew on the Internet and exposing the real story of what was going on behind the Iron Curtain of Scientology. Very few people were speaking out against Scientology at the time. Those who were speaking out were being heavily harassed by Scientology and their private investigators, as were we. Regardless of the harassment, I continued to speak out and expose anything that I thought would help end the abuses.\n\nWe felt we were alone at first, in all honesty we often felt quite like a Target commercial, with a big red bullseye painted on our rear ends waving in the wind. It has not been an easy road, and there were many times we had regrets, concern for our personal safety and that of our family, and where we wondered if we had made the right choice. But so many people have since stood up and added their voices to ours. It has been an incredibly liberating experience, a form of therapy in and of itself, and the moral support we received has been beyond words. To see organizations and groups form, Anonymous, independents, ex Scientologists, you name it, all of whom added their voices to ours, and who have brought Scientology abuses and criminality into mainstream view. Words cannot describe how important this has been to us personally. We could not have done this alone, and we are well aware of this fact.\n\nWe have never asked for financial support, nor expected any. We have made every effort to help people leave Scientology, helped them find jobs, provided food, lodging, references, financial advice, whatever we could do, knowing full well what it is to leave with nothing but the clothes on your back and absolutely no idea of where to turn. When we left in January 2005, it was tough. We had no-one to talk to that could understand what we were going through - the adjustment process when one leaves is not an easy path to travel. Learning to live life in the real world has its difficulties when you have no money, no job, no resume, no assets to your name, no credit, etc. There was no network of ex Scientologists, Anonymous and independents to turn to for advice or help in any form. Ex-Sea org members, particularly those from the Base, were kept carefully segregated. That was a big problem OSA had with us from the start: we worked hard and fast to find people who left, connect them to lost friends, join together and support one another. In fact, we held the first official SP party at our house in December 2007, even with private investigators sitting in our drive way. We have been more than happy to provide help to many ex-members recovering from the after effects of Scientology abuse, in any way we could. Over the years, we've spent tens of thousand of dollars helping people leave and get on their feet, and we will continue to help in any way we can.\n\nSome of scientology's abuses that we have helped expose include but are not limited to:\n\n1. \"Blow Drills\" where ex members are tracked, hunted down and brought back to the Sea Org and punished for attempting to leave.\n\n2. That Sea Org members were being paid less than slave wages in China.\n\n3. That Sea Org members were forced to perform difficult and unpleasant tasks as punishment at the whim of David Miscavige, such as cleaning out dried human excrement ponds at the International Headquarters.\n\n4.

The Tamil Nadu government had earlier asked the central government to allay the fears of the public before carrying out construction work.\n\n\n\nA resident of the village, speaking to IANS on phone, said around 300 policemen were in the village. With police resorting to cane and lobbing of tear gas, protestors started running and some tried to escape by running towards the sea.\n\n\n\nA Tamil television channel showed protestors throwing sand and stones at the police while being lobbed with tear gas shells.\n\n\n\nThe People's Movement Against Nuclear Energy (PMANE) - spearheading the anti-KNPP movement - had decided to take its fight against the Rs 17,120-crore project, away from Idinthakarai village near Kudankulam after officials had announced that enriched uranium fuel would be loaded in the first of the two nuclear reactors around September 11.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, around 8,000 people from eight villages near Kudankulam assembled at the beach since morning to stage their protest.\n\n\n\nThere is a prohibitory order against the assembly of people near the plant and around 4,000 policemen have been deployed around the plant site.\n\n\n\nwith inputs from IANS\n\n", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:52:40.012-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:52:40.012-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.indianexpress.com/news/kudankulam-nuclear-power-project-protests-spread-to-chennai/1000978/2", "title" : "Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project protests spread to Chennai", "text" : "Police had also resorted to lathicharge and firing of teargas shells yesterday as the seashore in Indinthakarai village turned into a battlefield with clashes between protesters and police.\n\nSlamming the police action, PMANE had yesterday launched a 48-hour relay fast against it.\n\nA cameraperson of an English TV channel allegedly suffered injuries on the forehead during the melee in the police action.

This large-scale nuclear power plant which the Indian government has been constructing in collaboration with Russian company Atomsroyexport, will have serious consequences for the life and ecology of the whole of peninsular India.\n\nOn September 10 2012, thousands of local people marched towards the Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant, as all their attempts to engage in a dialogue with the government over the last year had failed. The government responded to this peaceful protest with police violence, using teargas and baton charges against the protestors, particularly targeting women, who have been at the forefront of the movement,and forcing people including the children into the sea. A 44-year old fisherman has been killed in police firing in another protest in Tuticorn, a young girl was trampled to death, and many were injured. Meanwhile police also attacked the village of Idinthakkarai which has been the centre of the movement, and in the absence of the residents broke into homes and their place of worship and ransacked and vandalised them. Since then mass arrests and police raids on villages have continued.\n\nThe events of the last few days are a culmination of repression and militarisation of the area, (which has also been a feature of other nuclear power projects in India in Jaitapur and Fatehabad), in which non-violent protesters are being intimidated, harassed, imprisoned, and falsely charged. From one police station alone, charges have been brought against more than 55,000 people including 8,000 for sedition and ‘war against the state’.\n\nThe people are currently appealing to the Indian Supreme Court against the Chennai High Court decision to authorise the loading of uranium fuel rods for operationalising the plant. Any attempt to go ahead with fuelling the plant at this point is therefore a violation of basic democratic rights.\n\nThe protesters at Koodankulam are urging that the construction be halted because:\n\nJOIN THE INTERNATIONAL PROTESTS AGAINST THE KOODANKULAM NUCLEAR PLANT!\n\nNO MORE CHERNOBYLS!

I think he’s intelligent enough to know how difficult the job is – some would say the job is like being Prime Minister it’s almost impossible. But I think his whole life has been a preparation for this and I think he will carry the respect of the staff because editorially he’s accomplished. I think he’ll be a huge success.”\n\n“In terms of radio I think Local Radio, which was under attack at one point, is more and more important with the demise of local newspapers and local democracy. I think the decentralisation of the BBC out of London is more and more important. The big problem for George will be if Scotland votes for devolution – that’ll be a huge issue for the BBC.”\n\n“I don’t think the market can support commercial radio in speech news, local news, community news – and that’s a huge role for the BBC. I think the BBC’s role in local radio becomes more and more important and easily defined.”\n\nHere’s his first email to everyone on Monday morning:\n\nGood morning. On my first day as DG, I wanted to say hello and tell you how nice it feels to be doing the job for real after all those weeks of preparation. Over the next few months I’m going to be getting out and about, visiting as much of the BBC as I can. I’m looking forward to hearing your thoughts about the organisation – and your ideas about how we can make it better. I’ve done an interview for the Radio Times, where I answered readers’ questions, and that comes out tomorrow. But I want you to be the first to hear my plans for the BBC, so please watch my speech if you can tomorrow morning at 11am on the internal ringmain. Hope that’s all clear. More from me tomorrow, when I look forward to answering your questions and hearing what you think of my plans.

Prosecutors said Nakoula could face new criminal charges for lying to federal officials.\n\nNakoula, who was on supervised release from a 2010 conviction for bank fraud, faces eight charges of probation violation including making false statements to authorities about the film. When probation officials questioned him about the video, Nakoula allegedly claimed his role was limited to writing the script, and denied ever using the name “Sam Bacile” in connection to the film, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Robert Dugdale.\n\nMagistrate Judge Suzanne H. Segal ordered Nakoula detained, citing a “lengthy pattern of deception” by the man, adding that he poses “some danger to the community.” Nakoula could face up to three years behind bars.\n\nHe was arrested Thursday and ordered back to jail during an usual hearing. The hearing occurred amid high security, with the public only allowed to watch through a video feed in a separate courthouse blocks away. Before his arrest Thursday, Nakoula and his family had been in hiding, and his attorney said he had received threats to his safety.\n\nProbation officials have recommended a 24-month term for Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, prosecutors said in court. He faces a maximum of three years in prison if found to have violated his parole.\n\nThe filmmaker behind the anti-Islamic video “Innocence of Muslims” that has sparked violence across the globe faces up to three years in federal prison after being arrested Thursday for alleged probation violations.\n\nDugdale said none of the violations Nakoula is accused of relate to use of the Internet, even though his probation terms specify he was not permitted to possess or use a device with access to the Internet without permission from his supervisor. A trailer for the film uploaded on YouTube outraged Muslims the world over and has now become the centerpiece of a debate over the clash between free speech and hate speech. Arab leaders called on the U.S. to ban anti-Islam insults, while President Obama defended 1st Amendment protections for such speech even as he criticized the video as crude and offensive.\n\nAt Thursday’s hearing, Segal asked the man who went into hiding after the uproar over his film if his true name was Nakoula Basseley Nakoula. He said he had legally changed his name to Mark Basseley Youssef in 2002.\n\nNakoula’s attorney, Steven Seiden, asked that his client be released on $10,000 bond, saying that he was not a flight risk. He also said his client would be in danger at the downtown Metropolitan Detention Center because of what he said was a large Muslim population at the lockup.\n\nProsecutors told Segal they have been assured that the Metropolitan Detention Center has protocols to house “inmates of notoriety,” and contended that Nakoula would possibly be safer in custody. They said Nakoula was a man who “simply cannot be trusted” and whose deceptions had caused “real harm.” Because of his use of aliases, he was able to deceive people into working on the film without realizing they were dealing with a convicted felon, Dugdale told the judge.\n\nHe noted that Nakoula had applied for a passport in one name, obtained a driver’s license under another and used a third name -- which he spelled various ways -– while working on the film.\n\nDugdale said another mystery was Nakoula’s access to money, citing witnesses who received checks from the man for their work on the film.\n\nUsing the name Sam Bacile, he previously told the Associated Press the film was financed with $5 million from wealthy Jewish donors -– a figure experts said was hard to believe given the quality of the production. An actor who appeared in the movie has previously told The Times he was paid $75 a day in checks drawn on the bank account of Abanob Basseley Nakoula -– a name linked to the Cerritos property where Nakoula resides.\n\nSegal said Nakoula had failed to prove he wasn’t a flight risk. She said she was satisfied the security issue had been addressed by the Bureau of Prisons.\n\nAfter the hearing, vehicles marked Homeland Security blocked off a stretch of Main Street as three unmarked vans tore out of the courthouse and sped off in the direction of the federal lockup.\n\nChef who said he 'cooked' wife found guilty of second-degree murder", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:53:05.347-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:53:05.347-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/obama-netanyahu-agree-to-continue-regular-consultations-on-iran/2012/09/28/0944fb7c-0993-11e2-afff-d6c7f20a83bf_story.html?tid=pm_politics_pop", "title" : "Obama, Romney place dueling calls to Israel’s Netanyahu", "text" : "President Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke Friday by telephone, ending the call with a common pledge to stop Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon but no apparent consensus on a specific timeline to do so.\n\nA few hours later, Republican nominee Mitt Romney spoke by phone with Netanyahu, his one-time consulting colleague and a friend since the 1970s. After the call, Romney said that he does not believe military force will have to be used to stop Iran’s uranium enrichment program.\n\nThe dueling calls again edged Israel and Iran into the frame of the presidential election, and they gave both candidates an opportunity to outline their positions on an crucial security issue.\n\nAccording to a summary of the roughly 20-minute call released by the White House, Obama and Netanyahu “underscored that they are in full agreement on the shared goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.”\n\nThe statement also said the leaders, who have clashed over the now-dormant Palestinian peace process but rarely over Israeli security concerns, “agreed to continue their regular consultations on this issue going forward.”\n\nThe call came a day after Netanyahu told the U.N. General Assembly that Iran’s nuclear program would produce enough enriched uranium to make a weapon by spring or summer.\n\nUsing a cartoon image of a bomb to make his point, Netanyahu urged world leaders to present Iran with a “red line” that, if crossed, would result in a military strike.\n\nWhile delivered on a global stage, Netanyahu’s address was also aimed at Obama, who in his speech to the General Assembly on Tuesday spelled out the dangers that a nuclear-armed Iran would pose to the region and beyond.\n\nAlthough the president reiterated his position that the United States will do “what we must” to prevent that from happening, Obama declined to specify what steps by Iran would trigger a military operation.\n\nIran denies that it is enriching uranium for a weapon, but Israel and the United States do not believe the claim. The Israeli government has an undeclared nuclear arsenal itself, which Iran and others this week called for it to acknowledge.\n\nAccording to the White House summary of Friday’s call, Netanyahu “welcomed President Obama’s commitment before the United Nations General Assembly.”\n\nThe leaders spoke by phone because Obama, just six weeks from the election, declined to meet with any foreign leaders at the General Assembly this year. Netanyahu met Thursday with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\nRomney called Netanyahu during his drive to the airport after a campaign event in Wayne, Pa.\n\nThe Republican has criticized Obama for failing to curb Iran’s nuclear program. But the approach he has outlined — economic sanctions, a greater U.S. naval presence in the region and diplomatic isolation of Tehran— is largely consistent with the president’s policy.\n\nAsked Friday whether he endorsed the timeline Netanyahu spelled out at the United Nations, Romney said, “We did not go into enough, into the kind of detail, that would define precisely where that red line would be.” He described the phone call as largely personal in nature rather than a detailed policy discussion.\n\nRomney did describe Iran’s nuclear program as the “greatest national security threat that we face” and said he would explore military options “in the event they were necessary.”\n\n“I do not believe that in the final analysis we will have to use military action,” Romney told reporters traveling with him. “I certainly hope we don’t have to. I can’t take that option off the table. It must be something which is known by the Iranians as a possible tool to be employed to prevent them from becoming nuclear. But I certainly hope that we can prevent any military action from having to be taken.”\n\nThe White House statement appeared designed, in part, to decrease the focus on Iran and its nuclear program at a politically sensitive time for the president.\n\nThe one-paragraph summary released by the White House uses the phrase “regular consultations” twice.\n\n“It’s obvious that harsh tones and rhetoric are not going to be helpful — that is quite clear,” U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters Friday at the United Nations when asked about Netanyahu’s U.N. speech. “What is also clear is that Iran needs to prove to the international community that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.”", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:53:05.856-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:53:05.856-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-gary-johnson-third-party-debate-20120927,0,940506.story?track=rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+latimes%2Fnews%2Fpolitics+%28L.A.+Times+-+Politics%29", "title" : "Lawsuit highlights difficulty of third-party involvement in debates", "text" : "The CPD has been attacked before for its stance toward lesser-known nominees, most prominently in 2000 for its decision to exclude third-party candidates from even being members of the audience at the debates. Green Party candidate Ralph Nader sued the commission for allegedly violating the Federal Election Campaign Act. Nader’s contention that the CPD violated the law’s stipulation that it not “endorse, support or oppose political candidates or political parties,” was eventually shot down by a D.C. Circuit Court in 2005.\n\nIn the suit, Johnson and his campaign accuse the commission, along with the Republican and Democratic national committees, of a “conspiracy” to meet in secret and create the rules for the debates, excluding third-party candidates and participating in what the lawsuit contends is a “restraint of trade” violating the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.\n\nLibertarian candidate Gary Johnson earlier this month filed a lawsuit against the Commission on Presidential Debates, claiming that the organization’s practices violate antitrust laws and alleging collusion between the commission and the country’s two dominant political parties.\n\nThe participants if this year’s presidential debates are set – Republican nominee Mitt Romney will face off against President Obama in a matchup that’s been obvious for months. But there are still other presidential candidates, and one in particular is keen on elbowing his way into the debates.\n\nDEBATE QUIZ: Who said it?\n\nJohnson has been approved to appear on the ballot for 47 states and Washington, D.C., with pending efforts in Oklahoma, Michigan and Pennsylvania, giving him a pool of 495 potential electoral votes, well above the commission’s requirement of 270 for admission into the debates.\n\nBut where Johnson falls short of the debate prerequisites is in national polling. The commission, drawing from five undisclosed polling sources, mandates that candidates reach at least 15% of the prospective vote nationwide in order to appear onstage. Johnson, in a recent CNN/ORC poll, is the preferred candidate of 3% of likely voters and 4% of registered voters. Gallup doesn’t include Johnson or other third-party candidates in its regular questionnaires, though a separate poll conducted between Sept. 6-9 placed just 1% of voters behind his campaign.\n\nJoe Hunter, communications director for Johnson’s campaign, said the decision is ultimately “up to the court; we certainly expect them to move quickly. If a debate occurs without resolution, then the harm will have been done.”\n\nAnd without being able to count on the debates to raise his profile, Johnson is instead relying on social media (the candidate held a second “Ask Me Anything” event on the popular site Reddit earlier Wednesday), radio advertisements and a series of tours, most recently of campuses ranging from New York University, Duke and UC Berkeley. Johnson also plans a response to the debates in lieu of on-stage participation.\n\nWhen asked during the question-and-answer event what individuals can do to aid him with his debate efforts, Johnson emphasized the necessity of grass-roots promotion.\n\n“The most effective thing that anyone can do is to go out and sell your immediate family, friends, and coworkers to the fact that there is a legitimate third choice. Perhaps the only choice,” Johnson said.\n\nJohnson’s lawsuit isn’t the only ongoing challenge to the current debate structure. An online petition calling for independent fact-checkers to be present at all debates providing “real-time review” of the candidates’ exchanges has quickly gathered nearly 230,000 signatures, amid a campaign that has seen increased attention paid to organizations like FactCheck.org and PolitiFact.\n\nGiven the short amount of time before the first debate on Wednesday, it’s unlikely that Johnson’s lawsuit will result in his inclusion, though it does serve as an example of one of the many hurdles set before candidates aiming for the presidency without the backing of either the Republican or Democratic establishment.\n\nThe CPD has yet to reply to a request to comment.\n\nFollow Politics Now on Twitter and Facebook", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:53:08.163-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:53:08.163-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/netanyahu-takes-iran-red-line-argument-to-un/2012/09/27/e7184228-08c7-11e2-858a-5311df86ab04_story.html", "title" : "Iran must be given nuclear ultimatum, Netanyahu tells U.N.", "text" : "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that a firm ultimatum to Iran is the only peaceful way to stop the regime in Tehran from getting atomic weapons, increasing pressure on President Obama weeks before the U.S. presidential election.\n\nNetanyahu’s address to the U.N. General Assembly was a highly public argument for a stronger U.S. threat to attack Iran if it does not back off from what the Israeli leader described as the final push toward a nuclear weapon. Israel and the United States say the program is intended to develop a weapon, an accusation that Iran denies.\n\nNetanyahu made a case, laced with historical references, for telling Iran explicitly where it must stop to forestall an outside attack. He also warned that time was running out.\n\n“At this late hour there is only one way to peacefully prevent Iran from getting atomic bombs,” Netan­yahu told the annual gathering. “And that is by placing a clear red line on Iran’s nuclear weapons program.”\n\nEstimates have varied widely on when Iran might have a nuclear weapon, but Netanyahu offered Israel’s most specific timetable yet when he said Tehran’s progress would be irreversible by next spring or summer.\n\nIn a bit of theater, Netanyahu illustrated his point by holding up a placard showing a cartoon-like bomb with a lighted fuse. Lines on the chart marked what he said was Iran’s progress toward a weapon. With a flourish, Netanyahu pulled a red marker from his pocket and drew a thick line across the cartoon just below the start of what he described as the third and final stage.\n\nSome of the diplomats in the audience squinted to see the chart; others seemed perplexed. The image quickly went viral on the Internet and drew praise in some quarters and criticism from opposition politicians back in Israel.\n\nNetanyahu never directly threatened his own attack on Iran, and his tone toward Obama was conciliatory, but his meaning was clear: If Iran won’t back down and the United States won’t act, Israel will be forced to do so.\n\nThe Obama administration has been irritated by what many advisers see as rising Israeli threats and pressure. Obama told the U.N. session on Tuesday that there is still time to negotiate a peaceful end to the most troublesome elements of Iran’s nuclear program. But he has refused to set a deadline for Iran to back down or to publicly outline precisely what Iranian nuclear milestone would trigger a U.S. attack.\n\nU.S. officials have said that an ultimatum now could kill chances for a peaceful deal to head off the Iranian program. The threat of war or a rupture with Israel, a close U.S. ally, is also an unwelcome topic in this election season.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has criticized Obama for being too hard on Israel and not hard enough on Iran. He responded to Netanyahu’s remarks with a statement saying: “I, like the rest of the American people, applaud the bravery of the people of Israel and stand with them in these dangerous times. The designs of the Iranian regime are a threat to America, Israel, and our friends and allies around the world.”\n\nOver the past six months, Netan­yahu has made an increasingly public case for a unilateral Israeli attack on Iran sometime soon. Some analysts think he is bluffing to force Obama’s hand, while others think he is serious.\n\nIsraeli leaders say they cannot afford to risk a nuclear weapon in the hands of a clerical regime pledged to Israel’s destruction.\n\nThe Israeli demand for a U.S. red line on Iran is the latest point of conflict in a testy personal relationship between Obama and Netan­yahu. Although U.S. officials regularly profess an unshakable alliance with Israel, the two leaders have done little to hide their mutual suspicion and dislike.\n\nBut in his speech, Netanyahu thanked the president for ruling out a Cold War-style containment strategy for Iran, saying that the clerical regime in Tehran would not be as responsible as Soviet leaders. And he talked about the United States and Israel working together to stop Iran.\n\nThe Israeli leader devoted much of his speech to portraying a nuclear-armed Iran as a threat not only to Israel but also to the entire world. He equated the threat of an Iranian regime with an atomic weapon to a nuclear-armed al-Qaeda, saying, “They’re both fired by the same hatred, they’re both driven by the same lust for violence.”\n\n“Who would be safe in Europe? Who would be safe in America? Who would be safe anywhere?” he asked.\n\nIran’s mission to the United Nations issued a lengthy refutation of Netanyahu’s accusations, calling them baseless.\n\nIn Israel, Shelly Yachimovich, leader of the opposition Labor Party, scoffed at Netanyahu’s use of a simple diagram to highlight his argument for a red line.\n\n“The drawing is very attractive,” she said on Channel 10 television, “but that is not what will influence the United States to become deeply involved and be our ally in every step we take.”\n\nA new Israeli government report leaked to local media concludes that international sanctions are hitting Iran hard, possibly undermining Netanyahu’s argument for tougher action.\n\nShaul Mofaz, who heads the centrist Kadima party, said that plans to confront Iran should take place behind closed doors. Speaking on Israel’s Channel 2 television, Mofaz noted that Obama “has said that Iran will not have a bomb . . . that he will prevent Iran from going nuclear. I think that’s a clear red line.”\n\nU.S. military and intelligence officials have said that an attack by Israel would be unlikely to destroy the Iranian program, possibly leaving the United States to finish the job and igniting a new war in the Middle East.\n\nJoel Greenberg in Jerusalem contributed to this report.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:53:08.727-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:53:08.727-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/Decoder-Wire/2012/0927/Is-47-percent-comment-sinking-Mitt-Romney-s-polls-video", "title" : "Is '47 percent' comment sinking Mitt Romney's polls? (+video)", "text" : "Gaffes don't typically have much effect, but Mitt Romney's secretly recorded remarks may have staying power. His polls started falling soon after his words went public – and continue to drop.\n\nIt’s been 10 days since Mitt Romney’s now-famous “47 percent” comments became public. Since then countless news stories have chewed over Mr. Romney’s secretly recorded assertion that 47 percent of US voters see themselves as “victims” and are too dependent on government to vote Republican. Are Romney’s words – plus the subsequent media focus – now dragging down his campaign?\n\nFrankly, we’ve been skeptical the “47 percent” stuff would have a measurable effect on the polls. Individual events seldom do, no matter what the cable news chattering clique says. When asked directly, many voters may disapprove of such sentiments, but would that really make them more or less likely to vote Romney? Isn’t it more probable it would just reinforce what they already felt, one way or another?\n\nYeah, well, we’re reconsidering that now, for two reasons. The first is that Romney’s polls worsened fairly quickly after the comments came out. Take Gallup’s daily tracking poll, which has been a bit more pro-Romney than other national surveys. It’s a seven-day, rolling average of numbers. On Sept. 22, the day its sample consisted of people all contacted after Romney’s words became public, it went from a 46 to 46 percent tied race to a 2 point Obama advantage. Since then it has continued to widen. Yesterday Obama was up by 6, 50 to 44 percent.\n\nAs Josh Marshall, the generally liberal editor of TalkingPointsMemo, notes: That doesn’t really prove anything. “But the correlation is extremely tight.”\n\nLooking at national poll averages, plus polls in the key states of Ohio and Florida, George Washington University associate professor of political science John Sides sees a 1 percent swing to Obama from the day before the “47 percent” became public to Sept. 23.\n\n“How confident am I that this 1% shift is due to 47%?” tweeted Mr. Sides, who previously has been skeptical of the comment’s immediate political effects. “Maybe 30%.”\n\nBut whatever the numbers say, it’s clear that the campaigns think the “47 percent” stuff could be electoral kryptonite. That’s our second reason. Look at what both campaign teams are actually doing: putting up ads that either highlight (Obama) or explain away (Romney) those fundraiser words.\n\nFriday, for instance, the Obama campaign has released a new 30-second spot it claims will run in swing states. It contains nothing but Romney’s own words. While photos of US workers fade in and out, Romney talks about the 47 percent feeling entitled to “health care, to food, to housing, to you name it.\"\n\nThe Romney campaign, for its part, has released a one-minute, \"Too Many Americans” spot that highlights the ex-Massachusetts governor’s assertion of compassion.\n\n“More Americans are living in poverty than when President Obama took office, and 15 million more are on food stamps,” says Romney, looking straight into the camera. “President Obama and I both care about poor and middle class families. The difference is my policies will make things better for them.... We should measure compassion by how many people can get off welfare and get a good-paying job.”\n\nOf course, there are only a few weeks now until the election. At this point, the Romney campaign probably did not think it would still have to devote time and money to “Message: I care” ads, to paraphrase President George H. W. Bush.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:53:10.224-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:53:10.224-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.veteransnewsnow.com/2012/09/21/215335-as-the-israeli-war-drums-beat/", "title" : "As The Israeli War Drums Beat", "text" : "My journey to this exotic and little understood land began with an invitation to “New Horizon – The First International Independent Filmmakers Festival”. It was a conference and festival held in Tehran from September 2nd through September 7th. Filmmakers and intellectuals from around the world attended. It was one of the most stimulating experiences that I have ever had and an effective bridge between diverse cultures and perspectives – with the purpose of promoting truth, justice, liberty, and peace.\n\nThis initiative was undertaken, not by America or other world leaders, but by a country unfairly besieged with sanctions and threats of war. My observations were in stark contrast to the perceptions of most Americans. What I experienced was a devout country with a love of God, family, and nation – and an uncompromising respect for the noblest of human endeavors.\n\nAs I write this, a giant, beautiful book, Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, lies next to me. Khayyam’s wonderful poems have survived the test of time and are a testament to the normally peaceful spirit of the Persian people. This treasure was given to me by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Inside its back cover, he inscribed the following for me (transcribed from Farsi):\n\nIn the name of God who loves human beings. I, you, we and all of us are pursuing truth and happiness for human beings, which is unfortunately a victim of world powers. This is a historical opportunity to undermine all inhuman relations and put an end to prejudices, which have questioned the truths and separates them, to build a new beautiful world based on love, justice and beauty. This is a historical and certainly achievable objective. It only needs our hands, minds and hearts to join each other. I pray Great God to bless you, who love humanity and wish success for all. I hope to meet you in a better future.\n\nI found President Ahmadinejad to be a humble man with a firm handshake and intense, intelligent eyes. Despite his courteous and dignified bearing, he has been regularly berated, and routinely misrepresented, by a controlled western media. Is their demonization justified, or has he been targeted as the lone political figure standing against Zionist powers? This is my attempt to represent truths, such that the world might have a better understanding of Iran, its people, and its leadership.\n\nThe Iranian people are similar to Europeans in appearance…a beautiful people, poised and kind. Their women wear clothing which modestly cover them, but in elegant fashion and with serene faces that are usually exposed. They return smiles and are not treated as second class citizens, as we have been conditioned to believe. In fact, they outnumber men in higher education enrollments. There is no profanity and women are safe on any Tehran street – at any time of day or night. The influences of western civilization have not been totally removed, but the Iranians resist the decadence of cultural-Marxism. I attribute this largely to their faith and love of family. I was surprised to discover that the Islamic faith actually honors Jesus and Christianity. However, through Zionist media control, policy dictates, and other manipulations, the Christian world is incessantly convinced that Muslims should be our enemies and that we should be theirs.\n\nMuslims look with jaundiced eye upon the outrageous media lies and perpetual assaults on their faith and culture. Hollywood’s promotion of twisted films can provoke extremist reactions, and we are then led to believe that Muslims are all radicals. We never question the bizarre promotion of these divisive, Zionist inspired productions, or the actions of multinational interests in the internal affairs of sovereign Islamic nations.\n\nWere we to look honestly at the many false portrayals, we would see remarkable similarities to how our Christian communities have also been assaulted – increasingly with contempt and disrespect by these same Zionist and Cultural Marxist propagandists. They seek a globalist new world order – devoid of the diversity and freedoms associated with independent nation states.\n\nAs I wandered from the festival grounds to meet people on the streets, I found them to be most helpful and without animosity – despite my obvious American nationality. I enjoyed their exotic food and came to appreciate the craftsmanship of their products. The only negative sensation that I had was in witnessing the mad house traffic situation in Tehran. A city of 15 million, it has grown faster that it’s infrastructure. Despite this, the city is thriving with new construction and beautiful parks and monuments – which reflect a noble and accomplished people. The Iranians seemingly love Americans, but are rightly concerned and critical of our irrational and invasive government policies. The common response seems to be “why would your country want to attack us?”\n\nThe current condemnation of Iran is supposedly due to the possibility that they may develop nuclear weapons. We should all work for a world free from nuclear threat, but the sovereignty of nations must also be respected. Iran is signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has opened their facilities for inspection, declaring their interest is for energy development only. No evidence to the contrary has been shown, and Iran’s Supreme Leader, the Ayatollah Khamenei condemns nuclear weaponry – actually declaring a “Fatwa” against them – as it is contrary to their nation’s faith.\n\nHowever, Israel, their chief accuser (and architect behind the campaign to falsely accuse Iraq of possessing “weapons of mass destruction”), is believed to possess over 300 nuclear weapons. Israel is not signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has no intention of sharing information or opening their facilities for inspection – yet America continues to march to their fanatical war drums against others. Why is there no pressure on Israel to meet the same standards and why are we imposing “sanctions” against a nation that has done us no wrong? It is a preliminary act of war, and only imposed because Israeli lobbies demand it of our lap-dog politicians, who incredibly serve Zionist interests rather than the American people.\n\nIran is a strategic rival for regional hegemony in the resource rich middle-east and has stood strong for Islamic unity. They also courageously and most justifiably call for an end to the Palestinian occupation – the ruthless suppression of an enslaved people, largely funded by America. There is no greater injustice than that being perpetrated against the Palestinian people. World condemnation, through the United Nations is consistently blocked by U.S. actions on the Security Council. As a result, the Non Aligned Nations Movement (NAM) is growing as an alternative to the UN. Its recent success is not generally reported in Western media, but 120 nations came together in Tehran the week before the New Horizon Film Festival – in unity and in opposition to the evils of the Israeli occupation of Palestine. The Secretary General of the United Nations even attended, as well as observers from Russia and China. The Palestinian occupation and Israeli aggressions (including “false flag” operations against other nations) are at the root of the discontents for Zionism.\n\nAs President Ahmadinejad gave me a copy of Khayyam’s works, I gave him copy of my western motion picture, “Jericho”, and my political book, “Our Vision for America”. When I asked him what messages I might convey to the American people, he indicated “truths” and “Iran’s desire for peace”. Through lies and evil acts, Globalists and Zionists falsely portray Iran, as they seek conflict between nations. I later told him that our State Department should be meeting with Iran’s leaders and not depending on the initiatives of private citizens, like me. However, I hope that he and the Iranian people take hope in the prospect that many patriotic Americans are awakening to the evils that have consumed us, even while our politicians continue to betray the otherwise good spirit and traditions of the American people. Growing numbers seek answers that might save America and truly promote world peace.\n\nAmericans do not want war, and are beginning to realize that our politicians, of both major parties, initiate these actions against the wishes of the American people – and in accord with the intrigues of international bankers and their Zionist agents. It is time we stopped them by creating alternatives in politics, and in media.\n\nIran sees the need and is taking appropriate initiatives, and so should America.\n\nI went to Iran to promote the prospects for producing “False Flag”, a critically important motion picture. I returned to America more committed than ever to produce this political thriller and, through commercial entertainment, help awaken a sleeping America.\n\nVital truths must be revealed so that new evils are not perpetrated against the people of America and Iran, with destructive effects resonating throughout the world. I also return committed to building a viable third party, which will represent traditional working class Americans, rather than perpetuating a corrupt two party system, which serves special global interests. God willing, my answer to the courageous efforts of President Ahmadinejad is “I also hope to meet you in a better future”.\n\nMerlin Miller is a West Point graduate, US Army veteran, engineer, writer, filmmaker (www.Americana-Pictures.com) and 2012 Presidential candidate (www.MerlinMiller2012.com)", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:53:15.814-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:53:15.814-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/21/romney-to-release-2011-tax-returns/", "title" : "Romney Releases 2011 Tax Returns", "text" : "Read the most current version of this story here.\n\nMitt Romney paid $1.95 million in taxes on his 2011 investment income of $13.7 million, his campaign revealed on Friday, making good on Mr. Romney’s promise earlier this year to eventually release his full returns for that year.\n\nMr. Romney, who made millions by running Bain Capital, a private equity firm, paid an effective federal tax rate of 14.1 percent in taxes, primarily because most of his income was in the form of capital gains that are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Mr. Romney has said that he has paid at least 13 percent in federal income taxes in each of the last 10 years.\n\nIn order for that claim to be true in 2011, Mr. Romney had to voluntarily take a smaller deduction than he was entitled to for his charitable deductions, his advisers said Friday.\n\nMr. Romney and his wife, Ann, donated about $4 million to charity in 2011, but claimed only $2.25 million as a deduction. The campaign said that Mr. Romney’s tax liability would have been far lower in 2011 had the Romneys claimed the full deduction for their charitable contributions.\n\n“The Romneys thus limited their deduction of charitable contributions to conform to the governor’s statement in August, based upon the January estimate of income, that he paid at least 13 percent in income taxes in each of the last 10 years,” said R. Bradford Malt, Mr. Romney’s trustee.\n\nIt is possible, however, that Mr. Romney could still deduct the unclaimed amount of his charitable donations in future tax years, experts said.\n\nThe Republican presidential nominee, who released his 2010 tax returns in January, continues to refuse demands from President Obama’s campaign and other Democrats to release multiple years of his returns. Mr. Obama has sought to portray Mr. Romney as an out-of-touch millionaire who used off-shore accounts and accounting gimmicks to reduce his tax liability.\n\nIn an indication that the summaries will not satisfy Mr. Romney’s critics, Brad Woodhouse, the communications director for the Democratic National Committee, posted the following message on Twitter: “Summaries? What is Romney hiding? This isn’t just abt rates — how about Swiss Bank Accts, Bermuda Shell Cos and Caymans Investments?”\n\nBut Mr. Romney released a letter later Friday from his tax advisers providing a summary of his tax liability for a 20-year period from 1990 to 2009. The summary says that Mr. Romney paid taxes every year during that period, that the lowest annual federal tax rate was 13.66 percent and that the Romneys gave an average of 13.45 percent of their income to charity during the period.\n\nThe bottom-line numbers provided by Mr. Romney’s trustee were the first to be reported. But answers to more detailed questions will take longer to discover amid the many pages of documents released by the Republican campaign.\n\nAmong the questions raised by Mr. Romney’s critics, including advisers to Mr. Obama’s campaign: How much money, if any, did Mr. Romney pay in foreign taxes in 2011? How much money, if any, remains sheltered in overseas accounts? What are his remaining ties to Bain Capital, the firm he founded?\n\nThe letter from Mr. Romney’s tax accountants appears to directly contradict unsubstantiated assertions from Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader. Mr. Reid had asserted this summer that someone told him Mr. Romney paid no federal income taxes at all for ten years.\n\nMr. Reid made the allegation in interviews and on the floor of the Senate but repeatedly refused to say who provided him the information. Mr. Romney angrily accused Mr. Reid of lying, saying that the top Democrat in the Senate should “put up or shut up.”\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Mr. Reid did not repeat his claim, but continued to attack Mr. Romney for a lack of transparency by releasing only summary of most of his tax returns.\n\n“When will the American people see the returns he filed before he was running for president?,” Mr. Reid said. “Governor Romney is showing us what he does when the public is looking. The true test of his character would be to show what he did when everyone was not looking at his taxes.”\n\nMr. Reid also accused Mr. Romney of “manipulating” his 2011 tax return by deducing less than he was entitled to from charitable deductions so that his effective tax rate was higher.\n\n“That raises the question: what else in those returns has Romney manipulated?” Mr. Reid said.\n\nThe letter released on Friday from Price Waterhouse Coopers, Mr. Romney’s tax preparers, said that Mr. Romney paid taxes every year from 1990 to 2009.\n\n“In each year during the entire 20-year period, the Romneys owed both state and federal income taxes,” the company wrote. “Over the entire 20-year period, the lowest annual effective federal personal tax rate was 13.66%.”\n\nFor months during the Republican primaries, Mr. Romney refused to release any information about the taxes he had paid, saying the information was not relevant despite a tradition of disclosure by presidential candidates that dates to his father’s 1968 bid for the presidency. George W. Romney released 12 years of returns.\n\nIn April, under pressure from his Republican rivals for the nomination and Democratic critics, Mr. Romney had estimated he would owe $3.2 million in taxes on $20.9 million in income during 2011. At the time, he promised to release the full returns before Election Day.\n\nHis decision to release the tax documents on a Friday afternoon could help his campaign minimize news coverage of them. Politicians often try to release potentially damaging information just before a weekend, when voters are often paying less attention to their televisions and newspapers.\n\nIn spite of the timing, the release of the tax return is almost certain to rekindle the discussion about Mr. Romney’s personal wealth and Democratic attacks that his aggressive use of legal tax avoidance techniques sets him apart from average Americans.\n\nIn an Obama television ad, a narrator mentions tax havens, offshore accounts and carried interest and then says: “Makes you wonder if some years he paid any taxes at all. We don’t know because Romney has released just one full year of his tax returns.”\n\nDemocrats have sought to link Mr. Romney’s personal tax returns to the tax policies he would pursue if he were elected president. Mr. Obama argues that Mr. Romney’s tax policies are designed to provide tax cuts to wealthy people, which would lead to tax increases for middle-class citizens.\n\n“Governor Romney’s tax plan would actually raise taxes on middle-class families with children by an average of $2,000,” Mr. Obama said last month at an event in New Hampshire. “Not to reduce the deficit, or grow jobs, or invest in education — but to give another tax cut to people like him.”\n\nAt a rally in Cincinnati earlier this week, Mr. Obama mocked the complexity of Mr. Romney’s tax returns.\n\n“I’ve actually done my own taxes,” Mr. Obama said. “I don’t know about some of these other folks, but I’ve done them, you know… So I know we can make it more simple and more fair.”\n\nMr. Romney’s campaign has argued that his personal wealth is not relevant to the broader debate about who is best able to lead the country out of a sluggish economy.\n\nLast month, Mr. Romney said the continued focus on his personal tax returns by his Democratic opponents and the news media was “small-minded” in light of the economic problems that the country faces. His wife, Ann, has said the campaign was resisting a disclosure that would go back years because opponents would use the information against Mr. Romney.\n\n“The more we get attacked, the more we get questioned, the more we get pushed,” Mrs. Romney said in an interview on NBC’s “Rock Center” last month. “There’s going to be no more tax releases given. Mitt is honest. His integrity is just golden.”\n\nBut Mr. Romney had little choice but to release the full details of his 2011 tax returns, having promised to do so earlier in the year.\n\nIn an amended return, Paul Ryan, the vice presidential candidate, told the I.R.S. he and his wife had “inadvertently” failed to report $61,122 in income from 2011. That raised their total income to $323,416 and increased their taxes by $19,917 to $64,674, or 20 percent of adjusted gross income.\n\nThey owed a penalty of $59 for the original underpayment.\n\nThey explained that they had overlooked their income from the Prudence Little Living Trust. Mrs. Little, who died in 2010, was Mrs. Ryan’s mother.\n\nIn a statement, Stephanie Cutter, the deputy campaign manager for Mr. Obama, said Mr. Romney’s 2011 tax return confirms that “people like Mitt Romney pay a lower tax rate than many middle class families because of a set of complex loopholes and tax shelters only available to those at the top.\n\nMs. Cutter added that Mr. Romney “continues to fail” the test of full disclosure by releasing only a summary of his earlier tax returns. But she said the 2011 return confirms “that he continues to profit from millions of dollars invested overseas.”", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:53:18.217-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:53:18.217-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-09-21/news/34007755_1_obama-and-ryan-voucher-like-system-paul-ryan", "title" : "President Obama and Paul Ryan talk Medicare at AARP forum, with Ryan getting some boos", "text" : "Turning up the heat on Republican Mitt Romney's campaign stumble, President Barack Obama on Friday accused his rival of writing off half the country while defending his own remark that ``you can't change Washington from the inside.''\n\n``We don't want an inside job in Washington, we want change in Washington,'' Obama told a rally in Virginia, one of a handful of tightly contested states where the election is being fought heading into its final six weeks. ``It can't happen if you write off half the nation before you even took office.''\n\nObama was referring to a secretly recorded video that emerged this week in which Romney told donors that 47 percent of Americans don't pay income taxes and are dependent on government and ``my job is not to worry about those people.'' But the video has become so ubiquitous in the campaign that he didn't even have to explain the reference to draws cheers from his supporters.\n\nMeanwhile, Romney's campaign disclosed that he paid nearly $2 million on more than $13 million in income last year, mostly from investments, for an effective tax rate of 14.1 percent. The Republican's low tax rate was bound to be an issue in the campaign with issues of wealth and income taxes becoming more prominent with the revelation of the video this week.\n\nObama and Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan attacked one another over their plans for Medicare, the popular federal entitlement program for seniors, as both campaigns tried to woo older voters at an AARP convention in New Orleans.\n\nRyan was booed when he said he and Romney would repeal Obama's health care program. But he argued that Obama's health care law has weakened Medicare and said the Republican ticket would give seniors more choice in their health care coverage if elected.\n\n``Mitt Romney and I share your concerns, and we respect you enough to level with you,'' Ryan said. ``We respect all the people in this country enough to talk about the clear choices we face on Medicare, Social Security, the economy, and the kind of country our children will inherit.''\n\nAmericans 50 and over — the age that qualifies for AARP membership — are an especially important demographic for the candidates to persuade because they register in greater numbers those who are younger and are almost twice as likely to cast their ballot. An Associated Press-GfK poll that was released this week found Romney was favored by seniors likely to vote, 52 percent to 41 percent for Obama.\n\nObama was airing an ad Friday in Colorado, Florida and Iowa that argued Romney and Ryan would turn Medicare into a voucher program that could raise seniors' health costs by up to $6,400 a year.\n\nBut Obama conceded Friday, in response to a question posed during the AARP address, that that increase is based on a previous plan presented by Romney's running, Paul Ryan. Indeed, Romney would offer Medicare beneficiaries a choice between staying on traditional Medicare or to purchase private insurance through a voucher-like system.\n\nBut Obama, delivering his most expansive and detailed argument against Romney's Medicare plan, said that despite that choice, seniors would still suffer because only the healthiest would benefit from purchasing private insurance with a voucher plan while older Americans with greater health care needs would face rising premiums under traditional Medicare.\n\nRyan, speaking about an hour later, said describing it as a voucher was a ``poll-tested word to scare seniors'' when the idea is to force insurance companies to compete against each other to better serve seniors.\n\nRyan also said he and Romney want to raise the retirement age for Social Security and slow the growth of benefits for higher income earners to keep the program solvent.\n\nObama, who has not offered a comprehensive plan to address Social Security's long-term financial problems, said he would consider increasing the cap on Social Security taxes so that higher earners would pay slightly more toward the Social Security fund. Currently, the Social Security tax applies to income up to $110,100 in income.\n\n``I do think that looking at changing the cap is an important aspect of putting Social Security on a more stable footing,'' he said.\n\nRomney was holding a campaign rally Friday in Nevada, where he was expected to continue pressing Obama on his comment Thursday that ``you can't change Washington from the inside. You can only change it from the outside.'' Romney's campaign argued the president was admitting he failed to create the hope and change he ran on in 2008.\n\n``I can change Washington,'' Romney said Thursday. ``I will change Washington. We'll get the job done from the inside. Republicans and Democrats will come together.''\n\nThe president's campaign countered quickly by noting that Romney said exactly that in 2007, when he was running for the 2008 Republican nomination: ``I don't think you change Washington from the inside. I think you change it from the outside.''\n\nObama mocked Romney for jumping on his remark so quickly. ``What kind of inside job is he talking about?'' Obama said. He questioned whether that meant Romney would rubberstamp the agenda of congressional Republicans or let oil companies run the country's energy policy.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:53:19.614-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:53:19.614-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://dailycaller.com/2012/09/21/poll-gary-johnson-rakes-in-six-percent-of-the-vote/", "title" : "Poll: Gary Johnson rakes in six percent of the vote", "text" : "Libertarian Party presidential candidate Gary Johnson is supported by six percent of likely voters, according to a new Reason-Rupe poll.\n\nJohnson also has a favorability rating of seven percent, though 65 percent of likely voters said they had never heard of him, and 14 percent hold an unfavorable view.\n\nJohnson is still polling far behind the major party candidates, with President Barack Obama taking 49 percent and Republican challenger Mitt Romney taking 40 percent in a three-way race, according to Reason-Rupe.\n\nA JZ Analytics/Washington Times poll from May had the Libertarian at only two percent. And a second JZ Analytics poll from July had Johnson at 5.3 percent.\n\nAnother JZ Analytics poll from earlier this month, however, put Johnson at just 4.3 percent.\n\nPoll results vary widely in individual states as well. A recent Denver Post poll found Johnson commanding only three percent support in Colorado, while Public Policy Polling recently gave Johnson seven percent support in Montana.\n\nIn Johnson’s home state of New Mexico he polls at seven percent, according to the Albuquerque Journal. And a Gravis Marketing/Captol Correspondent poll from this month gives Johnson 4.5 percent in Ohio.\n\nA Gravis poll also has Johnson with 3.8 percent in Virginia, taking one percent support away from both Romney and Obama.\n\nJohnson’s libertarian ideas have been gaining steam recently, particularly with growing public support for marijuana legalization, reining in government spending and allowing gay couples to marry.\n\nEven the conservative tea party movement has begun to take on libertarian characteristics, argues one study.\n\nA recent study by the libertarian Cato Institute suggests that the tea party movement is more libertarian than people think, and pigeon-holing the tea party as part of the “religious right” may be a mistake.\n\n“The tea party is upending the conventional wisdom that Republican candidates must placate socially conservative voters to win primaries. Increasingly, Republican candidates must win over tea party voters on libertarian economic issues,” according to the study.\n\n“If you ask people questions, as various pollsters do periodically … like ‘is government too big?’ or ‘does government need to do more to help people,’ ‘should government push traditional values?’ or ‘should government stay out of the realm of values’ you can identify something like 15-20 percent of the public as holding libertarian views,” David Boaz, vice president of the Cato Institute, previously told The Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Ryan answered similarly the second time, hitting Romney for his word choice but attempting to make the larger point that the Republican ticket believes too many people are dependent on government:\n\n\"Oh I think he would have said it differently, that's for sure,\" Ryan said. \"But the point still stands, we have too many people becoming too dependent on government because of the poor economic policies of the Obama administration.\"\n\nIn another interview with News 9 in New Hampshire on Tuesday, Ryan spent the first four minutes of a six-and-a-half minute interview attempting to explain what Romney said.

See the original blurred videos here.]\n\nHere is Romney expressing his disdain for Americans who back the president:\n\nAt the dinner, Romney often stuck to familiar talking points. But there were moments when he went beyond the familiar campaign lines. Describing his family background, he quipped about his father, \"Had he been born of Mexican parents, I'd have a better shot of winning this.\" Contending that he is a self-made millionaire who earned his own fortune, Romney insisted, \"I have inherited nothing.\" He remarked, \"There is a perception, 'Oh, we were born with a silver spoon, he never had to earn anything and so forth.' Frankly, I was born with a silver spoon, which is the greatest gift you can have: which is to get born in America.\"\n\nRomney told the contributors that \"women are open to supporting me,\" but that \"we are having a much harder time with Hispanic voters, and if the Hispanic voting bloc becomes as committed to the Democrats as the African American voting block has in the past, why, we're in trouble as a party and, I think, as a nation.\" When one attendee asked how this group could help Romney sell himself to others, he answered, \"Frankly, what I need you to do is to raise millions of dollars.\" He added, \"The fact that I'm either tied or close to the president…that's very interesting.\"\n\nAsked why he wouldn't go full-throttle and assail Obama as corrupt, Romney explained the internal thinking of his campaign and revealed that he and his aides, in response to focus-group studies conducted by his consultants, were hesitant to hammer the president too hard out of fear of alienating independents who voted for Obama in 2008:\n\nWe speak with voters across the country about their perceptions. Those people I told you—the 5 to 6 or 7 percent that we have to bring onto our side—they all voted for Barack Obama four years ago. So, and by the way, when you say to them, \"Do you think Barack Obama is a failure?\" they overwhelmingly say no. They like him. But when you say, \"Are you disappointed that his policies haven't worked?\" they say yes. And because they voted for him, they don't want to be told that they were wrong, that he's a bad guy, that he did bad things, that he's corrupt. Those people that we have to get, they want to believe they did the right thing, but he just wasn't up to the task. They love the phrase that he's \"over his head.\" But if we're—but we, but you see, you and I, we spend our day with Republicans. We spend our days with people who agree with us. And these people are people who voted for him and don't agree with us. And so the things that animate us are not the things that animate them. And the best success I have at speaking with those people is saying, you know, the president has been a disappointment. He told you he'd keep unemployment below 8 percent. Hasn't been below eight percent since. Fifty percent of kids coming out of school can't get a job. Fifty percent. Fifty percent of the kids in high school in our 50 largest cities won't graduate from high school. What're they gonna do? These are the kinds of things that I can say to that audience that they nod their head and say, \"Yeah, I think you're right.\" What he's going to do, by the way, is try and vilify me as someone who's been successful, or who's, you know, closed businesses or laid people off, and is an evil bad guy. And that may work.\n\nTo assure the donors that he and his campaign knew what they were doing, Romney boasted about the consultants he had retained, emphasizing that several had worked for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:\n\nWhen one donor said he was disappointed that Romney wasn't attacking Obama with sufficient intellectual firepower, Romney groused that the campaign trail was no place for high-minded and detail-oriented arguments:\n\nWell, I wrote a book that lays out my view for what has to happen in the country, and people who are fascinated by policy will read the book. We have a website that lays out white papers on a whole series of issues that I care about. I have to tell you, I don't think this will have a significant impact on my electability. I wish it did. I think our ads will have a much bigger impact. I think the debates will have a big impact…My dad used to say, \"Being right early is not good in politics.\" And in a setting like this, a highly intellectual subject—discussion on a whole series of important topics typically doesn't win elections. And there are, there are, there are—for instance, this president won because of \"hope and change.\"\n\nRomney, who spoke confidently throughout the event and seemed quite at ease with the well-heeled group, insisted that his election in and of itself would lead to economic growth and that the markets would react favorably if his chances seemed good in the fall:\n\nThey'll probably be looking at what the polls are saying. If it looks like I'm going to win, the markets will be happy. If it looks like the president's going to win, the markets should not be terribly happy. It depends of course which markets you're talking about, which types of commodities and so forth, but my own view is that if we win on November 6th, there will be a great deal of optimism about the future of this country. We'll see capital come back and we'll see—without actually doing anything—we'll actually get a boost in the economy. If the president gets reelected, I don't know what will happen. I can—I can never predict what the markets will do. Sometimes it does the exact opposite of what I would have expected. But my own view is that if we get a \"Taxageddon,\" as they call it, January 1st, with this president, and with a Congress that can't work together, it's—it really is frightening.\n\nAt the dinner, Romney also said that the campaign purposefully was using Ann Romney \"sparingly…so that people don't get tired of her.\" And he noted that he had turned down an invitation from Saturday Night Live because such an appearance \"has the potential of looking slapstick and not presidential.\"\n\nHere was Romney raw and unplugged—sort of unscripted. With this crowd of fellow millionaires, he apparently felt free to utter what he really believes and would never dare say out in the open. He displayed a high degree of disgust for nearly half of his fellow citizens, lumping all Obama voters into a mass of shiftless moochers who don't contribute much, if anything, to society, and he indicated that he viewed the election as a battle between strivers (such as himself and the donors before him) and parasitic free-riders who lack character, fortitude, and initiative. Yet Romney explained to his patrons that he could not speak such harsh words about Obama in public, lest he insult those independent voters who sided with Obama in 2008 and whom he desperately needs in this election. These were sentiments not to be shared with the voters; it was inside information, available only to the select few who had paid for the privilege of experiencing the real Romney.\n\nALSO READ: More from the secret Romney video.

And he is interested in getting truths out about Iran.\"\n\nAhmadinejad, he said, expressed concern about the perspective Americans have on Iran because of what the filmmaker calls the country's \"Zionist-controlled media.\" Tensions between Iran and Israel have escalated rapidly under Ahmadinejad's rule.\n\n\"But I said it should be our State Department meeting with him, not me,\" Miller says.\n\nThe Iranian president also reportedly talked about the \"evils\" of western civilization, such as sexual promiscuity, a regular target of his criticism.\n\nMiller says he could relate to those sentiments because of years spent observing \"the decadence coming out of Hollywood.\" The independent filmmaker is currently shopping around a film called False Flag about the USS Liberty, a ship attacked in international waters by Israeli forces 45 years ago, which some veterans say resulted in a government cover-up.\n\nThe meeting with Ahmadinejad appears to have gone well.

Mitt Romney makes comments on the killing of U.S. embassy officials in Benghazi, Libya, while speaking in Jacksonville, Fla., Wednesday, Sept. 12, 2012. AP Photo/Charles Dharapak\n\n(CBS News) In a press conference Wednesday addressing the recent violence in Egypt and Libya, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney doubled down on his criticism of the Obama administration's handling of the attacks, calling its response a \"terrible course\" that signaled the administration is standing \"in apology for our values.\"\n\n\n\nThe Romney campaign put out a statement late last night -- on September 11 -- criticizing the president in connection with the violence. After he released the statement, it became known that four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens, were killed after an angry mob at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi in response to the production of an amateur anti-Islam film.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at a brief media availability Wednesday morning, the candidate defended his criticism, particularly targeting the White House over a statement from the Egyptian embassy that condemned \"the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims -- as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions.\"\n\n\"I also believe the administration was wrong to stand by a statement sympathizing with those who had breached our embassy in Egypt, instead of condemning their actions. It's never too early for the United States government to condemn attacks on Americans and to defend our values.\"\n\n\n\nRomney acknowledged that \"the White House distanced itself last night from the statement, saying it wasn't cleared by Washington.\" But even though he said he had the \"exact same reaction\" as the White House in doing so, he argued that because the statement was released the administration is sending \"mixed signals\" to the world.\n\n\"The White House also issued a statement saying it tried to distance itself from those comments and said they were not reflective of their views. I had the exact same reaction. These views were inappropriate. They were the wrong course to take when our embassy has been breached by protesters,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked what the White House did wrong, he argued, \"it's their administration.\" \n\n\n\n\"Their administration spoke. The president takes responsibility not just for the words that come from his mouth, but also from the words that come from his ambassadors from his administration, from his embassies, from his State Department,\" he said. \"They clearly sent mixed messages to the world and the statement that came from the administration and the embassy is the administration. The statement that came from the administration was -- was a statement which is akin to apology and I think was a -- a severe miscalculation.\"\n\nPresident Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have strongly condemned the attacks in separate appearances Wednesday, and Mr. Obama pledged that the United States is working with the Libyan government to bring to justice the attackers.\n\n\"We will not waver in commitment to see that justice will be done,\" Mr. Obama said from the White House Rose Garden. \"Make no mistake, justice will be done.\"\n\nObama spokesman Ben LaBolt, meanwhile, said Tuesday night he was \"shocked\" that the Republican nominee would use the occasion for a political attack.\n\n\"We are shocked that, at a time when the United States of America is confronting the tragic death of one of our diplomatic officers in Libya, Governor Romney would choose to launch a political attack,\" Obama spokesman Ben LaBolt said in a statement.\n\nRepublicans were seemingly slow to take up Romney's line of attack in light of the tragedy: Aside from RNC Chair Reince Priebus, who called the Obama administration \"sad and pathetic\" in a Tweet, there was little mention of the president in a flurry of Republican statements released Wednesday morning.\n\nEven some conservatives seemed to take issue with Romney's column: Columnist Peggy Noonan said on Fox News that she didn't feel Romney had been doing himself \"any favors\" in addressing the attacks.\n\nI was thinking as he spoke, I think I belong to the- to the old school of thinking: That in times of great drama and in heightened crisis and in times when something violent has happened to your people, I always think discretion is the better way to go,\" Noonan said. \"When you step forward in the midst of a political environment and start giving statements on something dramatic and violent that has happened, you're always leaving yourself open to accusations that you are trying to exploit things politically. I don't feel that Mr. Romney has been doing himself any favors, say, in the past few hours, perhaps since last night. Sometimes when really bad things happen, when hot things happen, cool words or no words is the way to go.\"\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, seized on Romney's remarks as \"reckless\" and evidence that he lacks a comprehensive understanding of foreign affairs.\n\n\"Governor Romney's comments are about as inappropriate as anything I've ever seen at this kind of a moment,\" said Democratic Sen. John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \"They are flat wrong. They demonstrate an insensitivity and lack of judgment about what is happening right now. To make those make those kind of statements before you even know the facts, before families have been notified, before things have played out, is really not just inexperienced, it's irresponsible, it's callous, it's reckless and I think he ought to apologize and I don't think he knows what he is talking about, frankly. It's that simple.\"\n\nDarrell West, the vice president of Governance Studies at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, told CBSNews.com he was surprised to see the Romney campaign double down on the attacks this morning.\n\n\"I saw the statement he put out last night and I thought it was maybe a low-level press person who put this out and today they would correct the damage,\" he said. \"Instead they're digging the hole deeper. I mean you can't really play partisan politics in U.S. foreign policy.\"\n\nSome question the assertion, however, that politics should be off-limits in addressing issues of national security -- even when tragedy is involved.\n\n\"I think to some degree this is just a question of what the American people think and what is their reaction to the administration's handling of this and to Romney's criticism. I think the average American will be shocked at the murder of an ambassador, which happens very, very rarely, and will wonder how did this happen? How could this have happened?\" said Elliott Abrams, currently a senior fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, who served under Ronald Reagan and as a senior director of the National Security Council to George W. Bush. \"There are a lot of questions to ask and I think most Americans will wonder what happened, so I don't think you can say the only appropriate remark is to pay tribute to Chris Stephens and nothing more can be said.\"\n\nRepublican strategist Trey Hardin called the notion that Romney was exploiting the situation for political gain \"out of line\" and said the comments were \"absolutely appropriate.\"\n\n\"From a protocol standpoint, he is a major voice in this country. We have a two-party system and he is the leader of that party right now,\" Hardin said. \n\n\n\nFrom a political standpoint, Romney stands to benefit from his remarks if he's able to successfully make the case to independent and undecided voters that the Obama administration's response is reflective of broader policy weaknesses. \n\n\n\n\"There is a perception from some out there that the Obama administration is not a very flag-waving U.S.A. rah-rah administration,\" said Ian Bremmer, president of the nonpartisan Eurasia Group, a global political risk research and consulting firm.\"I think Romney had a small opening. There's clearly a theme: Is Obama an apologist for other countries? Is Obama unpatriotic? Even if it's a small theme its one they continue to use. He's not going to win the election on that and he's not going to lose it either.\"", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:53:30.656-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:53:30.656-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/barack-obama-plans-to-offer-a-better-path-forward-in-democratic-convention-speech/2012/09/06/d285761a-f854-11e1-8b93-c4f4ab1c8d13_story.html", "title" : "In Democratic convention speech, Obama vows ‘our problems can be solved’ — with more time", "text" : "President Obama appealed to the nation Thursday night for another four years in office, asserting that his policies are slowly returning the country to economic prosperity while arguing that his Republican opponents would pursue a course that would set the country back and harm the well-being of middle-class families.\n\nObama said the choice between him and Republican Mitt Romney represents the clearest in a generation, a choice between sharply contrasting visions and political philosophies. But after entering office in January 2009 amid outsized expectations, he cautioned that the path he offers may be hard but will lead to “a better place.”\n\n“The truth is, it will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades,” he said. “It will require common effort, shared responsibility and the kind of bold, persistent experimentation that Franklin Roosevelt pursued during the only crisis worse than this one.”\n\nObama’s speech wrapped up a Democratic National Convention that combined a withering critique of Romney with a defense of the president’s record that Obama’s campaign team hopes will tip a closely fought election in their direction by November. Obama was aided immensely by the other two major speakers, first lady Michelle Obama and former president Bill Clinton.\n\nThe president spoke directly to the disappointment among some who supported him, and to the criticism from Republicans that his presidency has fallen far short of the promises he made in 2008.\n\n“If you turn away now,” he said, “if you buy into the cynicism that the change we fought for isn’t possible, well, change will not happen. . . . Only you can make sure that doesn’t happen. Only you have the power to move us forward.”\n\nPointing to last week’s Republican convention in Tampa, Obama said the speakers there talked more about the country’s problems than about how they would fix them: “They want your vote, but they don’t want you to know their plan. And that’s because all they have to offer is the same prescription they’ve had for the last 30 years.”\n\nObama’s convention played out against the backdrop of a country still mired in problems caused by the huge financial and housing collapse four years ago this month. The economy’s weakness and the public’s dissatisfaction with Obama’s handling of it pose the greatest threat to his prospects for reelection.\n\nObama spoke with the jobless rate at 8.3 percent — the 42nd consecutive month it has been above 8 percent — and with the economy adding jobs at a slow pace for months. The latest monthly jobs report will be issued early Friday morning, but economists have forecast little dramatic change in the jobless rate between now and Election Day in November.\n\nHe spoke to criticism that his policies have led to a bigger role for government in the economy and people’s lives: “We don’t think government can solve all our problems. But we don’t think that government is the source of all our problems — any more than are welfare recipients, or corporations, or unions, or immigrants, or gays, or any other group we’re told to blame for our troubles.”\n\nObama belittled the economic proposals of Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan. He said Romney’s budget math doesn’t add up, and he vowed never to “turn Medicare into a voucher.” His second-term policies, he said, could cut $4 trillion out of the deficit over a decade, create a million manufacturing jobs by 2016, cut net oil imports in half by the end of the decade and reduce the growth of college tuition by 50 percent over the next 10 years.\n\nThose goals are likely to be closely scrutinized by experts, given the fact that many of the objectives he laid out four years ago have not been met. Obama says that’s because of the depth of the problems he inherited. Republicans argue that it is because he has pursued policies that have made things worse.\n\nHe also was sharply critical of Romney’s foreign policy positions. “My opponent and his running mate are new to foreign policy, but from all that we’ve seen and heard, they want to take us back to an era of blustering and blundering that cost America so dearly,” he said. His opponents are “still stuck in a Cold War time warp,” he said, and he made fun of Romney’s recent foreign trip.\n\nVice President Biden used his acceptance speech to offer personal testimony about the president’s leadership and decision-making. “I’ve seen him tested,” he said. “I know his strength, his command, his faith. I also know the incredible confidence he has in all of you. . . . Yes, the work of recovery is not yet complete, but we are on our way. The journey of hope is not yet finished, but we are on our way. The cause of change is not fully accomplished, but we are on our way.”\n\nBiden focused on two big decisions, the one to bail out the auto industry and the one to take out Osama bin Laden. He summed up Obama’s record, as he has before, by saying, “Osama bin Laden is dead, and General Motors is alive.”\n\nOn autos, he said Obama went against the advice of some advisers and others and contrasted the president’s position with that of Romney’s.\n\nOf Romney, he said: “I just don’t think he understood what saving the automobile industry meant — to all of America. I think he saw it the Bain way. I think he saw it in terms of balance sheets and write-offs. Folks, the Bain way may bring your firm the highest profit. But it’s not the way to lead your country from its highest office.”\n\nThe decision to go after bin Laden carried even greater risks, with many of the president’s most senior foreign policy advisers opposed. “Bravery resides in the heart of Barack Obama,” he said. “And time and time again, I witnessed him summon it. This man has courage in his soul, compassion in his heart and steel in his spine.”\n\nBiden was introduced by his wife, Jill. A few hours before he spoke, Biden was formally ratified as Obama’s running mate after his name was placed in nomination by his son Beau Biden, the attorney general of Delaware.\n\nSen. John F. Kerry (Mass.), who was the Democratic nominee eight years ago and gave Obama the keynote address that launched him on the national stage, spoke Thursday night in his capacity as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nKerry said Obama has restored American credibility and moral authority abroad while keeping his promises to end the Iraq war and eliminate the threat posed by the al-Qaeda terrorist network that struck the country on Sept. 11, 2001. “Ask Osama bin Laden if he is better off now than he was four years ago,” he said.\n\nKerry argued that the choice in November is clear. “Will we protect our country and our allies, advance our interests and ideals, do battle where we must and make peace where we can?” he asked. “Or will we entrust our place in the world to someone who just hasn’t learned the lessons of the last decade?”\n\nKerry, who spoke just before a tribute to veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, ticked through a series of positions Romney has taken on different foreign policy crises. “Talk about being for it before you were against it!” he said, stealing a line of his own that was turned against him in his 2004 campaign. “Mr. Romney — here’s a little advice: Before you debate Barack Obama on foreign policy, you better finish the debate with yourself.”\n\nThe evening’s most poignant moment came just before 8 p.m., when Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was shot and gravely wounded in January 2011, led the audience in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nGiffords walked slowly across the stage, unaided but accompanied by one of her closest friends in Congress, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who chairs the Democratic National Committee. Giffords recited the pledge with a strong, clear voice. As delegates cheered and wiped away tears at the sight of her, she beamed a big smile back at them.\n\nSpeakers who appeared before the prime-time hour continued the pattern of the first two nights of the convention, appealing to crucial constituencies by warning that Republicans would take away abortion rights, or educational opportunity. Others skewered Romney as a wealthy, out-of-touch businessman whose record does not match his campaign’s claims that he knows how to turn around the economy.\n\nFormer Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm, shouting and pumping her fists through most of her speech, brought the audience to a fever pitch by attacking Romney for his opposition to the auto bailout. In a reference to the renovation of Romney’s California home, she said, “In Romney’s world, the cars get the elevator and the workers get the shaft.”\n\nObama spoke in the Time Warner Cable Arena after convention organizers scrubbed plans to hold Thursday’s program in the Bank of America outdoor football stadium.

Virtually every one is still viable, polling suggests...The idea is to hold onto some combination of states that he won last time around, Obama aides said...\" Peter Nicholas and Carol E. Lee in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAnd the auditions for 2016 have begun. \"Democrats gathering here for their national convention were given an early glimpse of some of the party’s ambitious prospects who have already started planting seeds for a potential presidential bid. It is far too early for a shortlist of prospective candidates, but nearly a dozen mayors, governors and members of Congress did little to hide their aspirations. Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland kept a bustling schedule here this week...Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles could barely pass a television camera -- or an influential Democrat from an early-voting state -- without stopping...And Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr...invited a few prominent Democratic officials from battleground states to join him in his skybox high at the convention hall...Senators Mark Warner of Virginia, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Kirsten E.

John Kerry on foreign policy. \"It took President Obama to restore our moral authority. It took President Obama to ban torture. The president understands that our values don’t limit our power. They magnify it. He showed that global leadership is a strategic imperative for America, not a favor that we do to other countries...Ask Osama bin Laden is he is better off now than he was four years ago...So on one side -- so on one side of this campaign we have a president who has made America lead like America again. And what is there on the other side? An extreme and expedient candidate who lacks the judgment and the vision so vital to the Oval Office, the most inexperienced foreign policy twosome to run for president and vice president in decades...[H]ere’s the choice in 2012; Mitt Romney out of touch at home, out of his depth abroad and out of the mainstream? Or Barack Obama, a president who is giving new life and truth to America’s indispensable role in the world.\" The Washington Post.\n\n@RameshPonnuru: Thought Kerry did a pretty good job of making his party's foreign policy case.\n\nMore: Kerry's five best lines, according to Politico's Kevin Cirilli.\n\n@jeffzeleny: Kerry comes equipped with a quiver of very sharp lines.

Or do you want to keep America moving forward? My dear friends, your vote is precious, almost sacred. It is the most powerful, nonviolent tool we have to create a more perfect union. Not too long ago, people stood in unmovable lines. They had to pass a so-called literacy test, pay a poll tax. On one occasion, a man was asked to count the number of bubbles in a bar of soap. On another occasion, one was asked to count the jelly beans in a jar—all to keep them from casting their ballots. Today it is unbelievable that there are Republican officials still trying to stop some people from voting. They are changing the rules, cutting polling hours and imposing requirements intended to suppress the vote.\" National Journal.\n\n@repjohnlewis: Our struggle to create the Beloved Community is not the struggle of a season or an election but the struggle of our lifetime.\n\nDr. Jill Biden on husband and VP Joe. \"I've seen Joe's character in his optimism. For families who have lost a loved one, kids struggling to find their way, workers out of a job, Joe always works to give people a sense of hope...I've also seen Joe's character in his determination...Finally, I've seen Joe's character in his heart...That's Joe -- that optimism, that determination, that big, strong heart that drives him forward every day.\" Politico.\n\n@mattyglesias: Jill Biden's defense of women who do jobs for money is a refreshing change from relentless mom-ism.\n\nFrmr. MI Gov. Jennifer Granholm on the auto comeback. \"The entire auto industry, and the lives of over one million hard-working Americans, teetered on the edge of collapse; and with it, the whole manufacturing sector. We looked everywhere for help. Almost nobody had the guts to help us – not the banks, not the private investors and not Bain capital. Then, in 2009, the cavalry arrived: our new president, Barack Obama! He organized a rescue, made the tough calls and saved the American auto industry...Well, in Romney's world, the cars get the elevator; the workers get the shaft...When American markets broke down, who jump-started the engine? Barack Obama! And when America needed it most, who got us rolling again on the road to recovery? Barack Obama! America, let's rev our engines! In your car and on your ballot, the 'D' is for drive forward, and the 'R' is for reverse. And in this election, we're driving forward, not back. Let's re-elect our great president, Barack Obama!\" Politico.\n\n@thegarance: Granholm's speech is hard-core cheese but the crowd are it up. I've never seen a woman do manufacturing sector-populism like that.\n\nNC Sen. Kay Hagan on her state. \"North Carolina is strong because our people are strong...We got there because we were blessed with leaders, from all walks of life, who were willing to do what was right; make difficult, not easy choices; and invest in our future generations. We got there because a group of civic leaders had the vision to look over thousands of acres of empty land and see the potential for Research Triangle Park, which today is a hub of innovation and job creation that employs tens of thousands of people...Our country needs that same forward-looking leadership now more than ever. The solutions of yesterday won't get us where we need to go. We can't get there by slashing education or cutting back on research and development.\" Politico.\n\nFrmr. FL Gov. Charlie Crist on Republicans. \"Half a century ago, Ronald Reagan, the man whose relentless optimism inspired me to enter politics, famously said that he didn't leave the Democratic Party; the party left him. I can certainly relate. I didn't leave the Republican Party; it left me...But as a former lifelong Republican, it pains me to tell you that today's Republicans -- and their standard-bearers, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan—just aren't up to the task.\" Politico.\n\n@jbarro: I see they ditched the plan for Charlie Crist to deliver his speech from inside a tanning booth.\n\nMT Gov. Brian Schweitzer on what don't hunt. \"Mitt's a good family man and a loyal American. But...he brought the wrong agenda to Massachusetts. And he is the wrong guy to be president of the United States. Governor Mitt Romney saddled Massachusetts taxpayers with an additional $2.6 billion in debt, and left 'em with the most debt per capita of any state in America. In Montana, that dog don't hunt. Governor Mitt Romney cut higher education by 14 percent in his first year, which meant the cost of college skyrocketed for students in Massachusetts. Guess that's okay if you can afford it, but for the rest of us, that dog don't hunt.\" Politico.\n\n@thegarance: I love that Brian Schweitzer was wearing a bolo tie. As someone partly from one of the other non-ironic bolo tie states.\n\nAsst. Leader and SC Rep. Jim Clyburn on the choice. \"President Obama has lit candle after candle, bringing our country out from the darkness of recession, only to see Republicans douse the flames and amuse themselves cursing the darkness...Let us go from this place, lighting candles all across this great country and re-elect President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden so they can continue moving our country forward into the light.\" Politico.\n\nLos Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa on diversity and community. \"This is a reflection of who we are as a party and who we can be as a nation, because as Democrats, as Americans, whenever we’ve opened up our party and our country, whenever we’ve opened up doors for more of our people, whenever we’ve deepened our democracy and renewed our commitment to equal justice under the law, we’ve grown stronger as a nation...In Los Angeles, we know our communities are stronger for their diversity. From Westwood to Wilmington, from Silver Lake to Sherman Oaks, we may come from different backgrounds, we may speak different languages, we may worship in different ways, but all of us -- no matter our accent or ancestry -- are pursuing the same American dream.\" Fox News Insider.\n\nKLEIN: All Obama needs is re-election. \"A peculiarity of Barack Obama’s reelection campaign is that the single most consequential thing he could do is get reelected. That’s true even if, after he gets reelected, he isn’t able to come to an agreement with Congress on anything more significant than keeping the lights on. What makes Obama’s most significant achievements unusual is that they roll out slowly...What’s unusual is that the policies that are most important to Obama and the Democrats don’t actually require compromise with Republicans. Health care, financial regulation and tax increases are on autopilot. If Obama wins reelection, Americans are going to see a lot of change even if Republicans don’t offer much cooperation. If he loses, much of the change he signed into law in his first term will never actually happen.\"\n\nThe President's agenda promises a return to post-recession normalcy. \"If you looked past the rhetoric and focused just on the policy, this was a modest speech. It was a more humble vision. What President Obama offered the country on the final night of the Democratic convention was reminiscent of what Warren G. Harding offered almost a century ago: A return to normalcy after a long period of emergency. Consider the problems -- and the solutions -- of Obama’s first term...This has not been a normal time. And it’s not been a normal time for a long time...But the time of politics being about abnormal solutions and awe-inspiring goals does appear to be over, at least in Obama’s agenda.\" Ezra Klein in The Washington Post.\n\nBARRO: Obama's dud of a speech. \"Last night, Bill Clinton showed us that it is possible to make a convincing case for the Obama economic record. Tonight, President Barack Obama showed us that he is personally incapable of making it...Obama did not give the sense that he has been working tirelessly to grow the economy as a whole, or that he was fixated on the fact that overall employment has not been rising fast enough. His plan for the jobs of the future was similarly narrow...There is little in this jobs agenda for conservatives or liberals to appreciate...But for conservatives who endorse the structural view of unemployment, the president’s proposals to address that look both small-bore and too heavy on central planning. Neither side should have listened to this speech and come away with the sense that Obama would do better on job creation in his second term than his first.\" Josh Barro in Bloomberg.\n\nBROOKS: The Democratic upper hand. \"Over the past two weeks, I’ve enjoyed a grand tour of solipsism. I’ve been to two party conventions filled with people who think all of America is just like them. In Tampa, Fla., the Republicans talked as if everybody in America has started a small business or wants to...The Republicans’ political problem is that most Americans don’t presently want every aspect of life to look like the market...The Democrats rally around a different sort of ideal...The big rise in this life is not a move up in economic class. It’s a move up in social status -- from a life where one’s conditions and lifestyle are imposed on you to a life in which you get to choose your own lifestyle...One of the striking features of the Democratic convention was that during the hours between 7 and 10 o’clock, when the party was appealing to its own activists, the social issues overshadowed the economic ones...Their second political problem is that the Democratic Party is inert. The party spent the years from the New Deal until Obamacare constructing a welfare state. That project is now finished, and today the party is dedicated to defending government in all its forms. This is a party with a protective agenda, not a change agenda.\" David Brooks in The New York Times.\n\nKRUGMAN: Why 'four more years' will be a better four. \"[I]s the mess really getting cleaned up? The answer, I would argue, is yes. The next four years are likely to be much better than the last four years...The forces that have been holding the economy back seem likely to fade away in the years ahead. Housing starts have been at extremely low levels for years, so the overhang of excess construction from the bubble years is long past — and it looks as if a housing recovery has already begun. Household debt is still high by historical standards, but the ratio of debt to G.D.P. is way down from its peak, setting the stage for stronger consumer demand looking forward...[Business investment] has actually been recovering rapidly since late 2009, and there’s every reason to expect it to keep rising as businesses see rising demand for their products.\" Paul Krugman in The New York Times.\n\nFIRESTONE: Joe Biden, an underrated talent. \"[T]he vice president is an expert in the art of overcoming ridicule and using low expectations to his advantage. In his convention speech tonight, he contrasted his father’s humbling experience in the auto industry with that of the Romney family...People who thought Mr. Biden was little more than a comic sidekick to the president got a better look at the man tonight, witnessing a vice president who made a passionate and surprisingly effective case for his boss. The speech had its sentimental moments, and the occasional over-hearty platitude, but he made his argument in the appealing and populist way that often connects Mr. Biden with middle-class crowds. Better than most speakers at the convention, he refuted the contemptuous Republican assertion that Democrats are constantly on the lookout for government handouts. People who need government help for a college loan or job training aren’t trying to become dependent, he said, they are seeking their own path out of dependency.\" David Firestone in The New York Times.\n\nDIONNE: Give Joe his due. \"Biden was effective, and at times powerful, speaking as a witness who watched Obama up close. And because of his reputation for saying what’s on his mind, which has often gotten him into trouble, he has a kind of credibility that doesn’t come automatically to those who are always, always on message. Biden has a gut understanding of white working class and less affluent middle class voters whom Obama needs because, basically, that’s where Biden comes from.\" E. J. Dionne in The Washington Post.\n\nDOUTHAT: Obama plays it safe. \"The strongest impression left by Mitt Romney’s convention speech last week was that the Republican nominee’s campaign sees itself on pace for a narrow victory in November, with no risks or course corrections needed. The impression left by President Obama’s convention speech tonight was that incumbent’s campaign feels exactly the same way. This was a pure stay-the-course speech, workmanlike and occasionally somewhat distant, with a few inspired and moving passages standing out amid a litany of rhetorical moves that the president has made many times before.\" Ross Douthat in The New York Times.\n\nBRUNI: Obama is too cool, and not in a good way. \"Perhaps the greatest paradox of American politics is that so many of its practitioners close in on -- or reach -- the pinnacle of the profession despite a fundamental inaptitude for one or another of its central demands...Barack Obama, the former law professor, prefers to fly at a lofty intellectual altitude and stand at a certain emotional remove. He’s a cool customer. But to get help and to get votes, a politician must make a warm and humble bid for them...He floats above. He holds back. And that rankles his allies and even some of his intimates not just because it wounds their vanity (though of course it does) but because it hampers his effectiveness. He loses some good will because of it. He forfeits opportunities. There are arms that go untwisted, egos that go un-stroked, backs that go un-slapped.\" Frank Bruni in The New York Times.\n\nMILKEN: Public investment in science isn't junk. \"Science matters..., [Y]et the government doesn't always see the full benefit in funding science. No matter how wondrous the drug, no matter how many lives it saves, enhances, lengthens or makes more productive, the development costs supported by federal grants fall only into the expense column when scored by the Office of Management and Budget or the Congressional Budget Office...[S]cientific breakthroughs, combined with public-health advances, underlie what is arguably the greatest accomplishment in human history: World-wide average life expectancy has more than doubled since 1900. This has fostered major social benefits and economic growth in this country and many others.\" Michael Milken in The Washington Post.\n\nHUBBARD: Obama's bad 'arithmetic.' \"Mr Obama has proposed to continue current elevated levels of federal spending, while raising taxes on higher-income households and businesses to reduce the deficit and debt consequences of higher spending...In contrast with Mr Romney’s plan, the president’s plan does not address medium-term and long-term deficit and debt problems. Taken at face value, the Obama plan will require acceptance of the costs of much higher levels of deficits and debt or substantial tax increases on all Americans...But the president is proposing higher tax burdens on certain households and businesses. Will those tax changes close the budget gap? No...Mr Obama proposes a larger government with explicitly higher taxes on high-income taxpayers but, by the arithmetic of higher spending levels, eventually higher taxes on all Americans.\" Glenn Hubbard in The Financial Times.\n\nWEISBERG: Julian Castro vs. Marco Rubio. \"American political conventions are now principally talent shows. In distributing the coveted primetime speaking slots, the parties showcase their future stars and give a chosen few their first taste of national celebrity...This year, both parties sent a strong message with their selection of up-and-comers: we’ve got the bright, young Latinos...The Rubio-Castro matchup frames a crucial competition: the battle for an electoral segment that could determine the election and will only become more important thereafter...Where Mr Rubio and Mr Castro diverge is in the lesson they draw from [their] immigrant experience. To Mr Rubio, Hispanics are refugees from foreign oppression, who want government to let them alone...In contrast, the 37-year old Mr Castro...sees government as an essential enabler of ethnic assimilation and success.\" Jacob Weisberg in The Financial Times.\n\nKRAUTHAMMER: The empathy gap. \"Given the state of the economy, by any historical standard, Barack Obama should be 15 points behind Mitt Romney. Why is he tied? The empathy gap. On 'caring about average people,' Obama wins by 22 points. Maintaining that gap was a principal goal of the Democratic convention. It’s the party’s only hope of winning in November. George H.W. Bush, Romney-like in aloofness, was once famously handed a staff cue card that read: 'Message: I care.' That was supposed to be speech guidance. Bush read the card. Out loud. Not surprisingly, he lost to Bill Clinton, a man who lives to care, who feels your pain better than you do -- or at least makes you think so. In politics, that’s a trivial distinction.\" Charles Krauthammer in The Washington Post.\n\nMatt Bai profiles an Ohio in recovery and the role of politicians: \"These competing theories of progress in Ohio [by Obama and Romney], waged 250 miles apart at the same moment, illustrate what may be the most important and confounding dynamic in this election. While most of the debate nationally still revolves around why the economy remains so pathetic, there are several pivotal states -- Ohio, Florida, Nevada, Virginia -- where things are slowly turning around. In these states, the real issue may not be who deserves blame for economic ruin but rather who deserves credit for a rebound, and what really causes jobs to come back after they’ve been lost. Republican governors are saying that unemployment rates have plummeted because of their pro-business policies. The president is saying that the hard decisions he made earlier in his term are finally starting to pay off. And then there’s Mitt Romney, a congenital optimist who finds himself in the uncomfortable position of having to be a total downer, arguing that there really isn’t a recovery at all. 'Trust Me: You’re Still Miserable' could be Romney’s bumper sticker in Ohio.\"\n\nTech interlude: The toothbrush which just saved the International Space Station.\n\nGot tips, additions, or comments?

Markets on both sides of the Atlantic rallied Thursday after the ECB approved a plan paving the way for the bank to make unlimited purchases in struggling euro members' bond markets. Stocks jumped throughout Asia in early Friday trading...Global stock and debt markets responded ebulliently to the plan, which would let the ECB conduct secondary-market purchases of bonds that are issued by troubled euro-zone governments and have maturities of one to three years.

They account for 76 percent of Medicaid’s beneficiaries, 51 million of the 67 million people the program covers. Those are the lion’s share of the Medicaid program’s enrollees. But those aren’t Medicaid’s big spenders. That title is held by the aged and disabled...The contrast is pretty stark: There are more than twice as many children enrolled on Medicaid as there are blind and disabled beneficiaries. In stark spending terms, however, the blind and disabled account for a significantly bigger share.\" Sarah Kliff in The Washington Post.\n\nFCC to propose airwaves auction. \"The Federal Communications Commission will propose on Friday a plan to auction off television airwaves to wireless carriers that will use them to create faster and more reliable networks, according to an official familiar with the plans.

It is one of a number of new studies showing that while big cities traditionally have been the nation's melting pots, today it is smaller cities and suburbs that are on the front lines of changing demographics and culture. Earlier this year researchers at the University of Minnesota Law School showed that in 2010, 44% of suburban residents live in a diverse community, defined as places that are 20% to 60% nonwhite.

Bill Clinton gave a roaring, detailed, and lengthy speech on Obama's behalf. \"Former President Bill Clinton delivered a spirited defense of President Obama’s handling of the nation’s struggling economy here Wednesday night as he criticized the economic agenda of Republican nominee Mitt Romney and an opposition GOP he argued has been unwilling to compromise for the good of the country. Clinton, in a speech to the Democratic National Convention formally nominating Obama that was aimed squarely at independent voters, said America is 'clearly better off' than four years ago and argued that many of the serious problems ailing the economy were 'inherited' from Republicans. He said that, despite the slow recovery, Obama has spent the last four years laying the foundation for a more vibrant and balanced economy and needs four more years to see that vision through.\" Philip Rucker and Dan Balz in The Washington Post.\n\n@ezraklein: Bill Clinton trusts the American people to care about policy, and so the American people trust Bill Clinton to tell them about it.\n\nExcerpts: \"In Tampa, the Republican argument against the president’s re-election was actually pretty simple -- pretty snappy. It went something like this: We left him a total mess. He hasn’t cleaned it up fast enough. So fire him and put us back in...Here’s the challenge he faces and the challenge all of you who support him face. I get it. I know it. I’ve been there. A lot of Americans are still angry and frustrated about this economy. If you look at the numbers, you know employment is growing, banks are beginning to lend again. And in a lot of places, housing prices are even beginning to pick up. But too many people do not feel it yet...President Obama started with a much weaker economy than I did. Listen to me, now. No president -- no president, not me, not any of my predecessors, no one could have fully repaired all the damage that he found in just four years. Now, he has laid the foundation for a new, modern, successful economy of shared prosperity. And if you will renew the president’s contract, you will feel it. You will feel it...If you want a winner-take- all, you’re-on-your-own society, you should support the Republican ticket. But if you want a country of shared opportunities and shared responsibility, a we’re-all-in-this-together society, you should vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden.\"\n\nWonkbookmark: The DNC speaking schedule for Thursday, which includes President Obama and Joe Biden.\n\nMA Sen. candidate Elizabeth Warren won the support of the convention floor for her anti-Wall Street populism. \"Clinton and Warren represented two wings of the party -- with Clinton the original architect of the centrist New Democrat philosophy that built bridges to business and brought the party back to the White House in the 1990s -- and Warren a strong voice for the progressive grassroots activists who have led an attack on Wall Street, big corporations and the so-called 'one percent.' Warren, the Harvard Law School professor who is fighting to unseat Republican Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts, got a huge response when she took the stage just ahead of Clinton. She delivered a populist blast, attacking what she said was a rigged system in which Wall Street and corporate America have profited while the middle class has been 'chipped, squeezed and hammered.'\" Philip Rucker and Dan Balz in The Washington Post.\n\n@rortybomb: I hope Democratic elites note that the audience couldn't stop applauding Warren's messages of basic economic fairness and accountability.\n\nExcerpts: \"[F]or many years now, our middle class has been chipped, squeezed, and hammered...People feel like the system is rigged against them. And here's the painful part: they're right. The system is rigged...No, Governor Romney, corporations are not people. People have hearts, they have kids, they get jobs, they get sick, they cry, they dance. They live, they love, and they die. And that matters. That matters because we don't run this country for corporations, we run it for people.\"\n\n@TobinCommentary: Warren plays left-wing populist card about system being rigged for rich.

Warnings of that future are not distractions. They're not imagined. That future could be real...It would be an America in which you have a new vice president who co-sponsored a bill that would allow pregnant women to die preventable deaths in our emergency rooms. An America in which states humiliate women by forcing us to endure invasive ultrasounds we don't want and our doctors say we don't need. An America in which access to birth control is controlled by people who will never use it; in which politicians redefine rape so survivors are victimized all over again; in which someone decides which domestic violence victims deserve help, and which don't.\" Politico.\n\n@davidfrum: Sandra Fluke would not be annoying conservatives tonight if Rush Limbaugh could debate a woman without hurling ugly names\n\nSister Simone Campbell on social justice. \"In June, I joined other Catholic sisters on a 2,700-mile bus journey through nine states to tell Americans about the budget Congressman Paul Ryan wrote and Governor Romney endorsed.

On top of that, they left behind an economy in free-fall...Congressman Ryan, America is literally in your debt...[Romney and Ryan] both pledged that they would never ask millionaires to pay one more dime to reduce the deficit. Mitt Romney even said he would reject a budget with ten dollars in spending cuts for every one dollar in new revenue. Now, a third-grader can do the math. If you refuse to ask the wealthiest to pitch in, then you hit everyone else much harder...This election is a choice. That choice will determine whether America is a place where people climb the ladder of opportunity and pull it up behind them or whether America is a place where people who reach the top help the next person up\" The Washington Post.\n\n@ezraklein: Chris Van Hollen's speech was the most specific, accurate attack on the Romney-Ryan plan by any Democrat so far.\n\nEducation Sec.

It's about giving every child a shot at a secure middle-class life...The president knows that the path to the middle class goes right through America's classrooms...Governor Romney will cut education for our children. That's the difference in this election. They see education as an expense. President Obama's sees it as an investment\" Politico.\n\nVeterans' Affairs Sec. Eric Shinseki on the troops. \"I first met Barack Obama in November 2008. I quickly realized we were both shaped and inspired by family members who served in World War II...During our first meeting nearly four years ago, the president’s commitment to veterans was clear...Since President Obama took office, nearly 800,000 veterans gained access to VA healthcare. There’s been a historic expansion of treatment for PTSD and traumatic brain injury. President Obama has expanded job training to prepare vets for the jobs of the future. And we’re on track to end veterans’ homelessness by 2015.\" Fox News Insider.\n\nDE Gov. Jack Markell on business experience. \"[A]s someone who has been a businessman and a governor, let me level with you: just because Mitt Romney was a successful private equity executive, that does not mean he deserves to be president. Because when you move from business to government, what matters are the lessons you learn and what those lessons say about your priorities. And Mitt Romney learned all the wrong lessons. As an executive in private equity, Mitt Romney's focus was on the bottom line...When you are a governor, or the president, it's different. Your shareholders are teachers, construction workers, and hardware store owners. And your bottom line is not what goes into your pocket—but what goes into theirs. That's the difference. When your constituents are your financial shareholders, perhaps it makes sense to take control of a company, suffocate it with debt, and get rid of the workers' pensions. That kind of thing worked for Mitt Romney when he sat in his corporate office. But it won't work for the country if Mitt Romney's sitting in the Oval Office.\" Politico.\n\nHouse Minority Leader and CA Rep. Nancy Pelosi on what's in a vote \"Many names are on the ballot.

If so, he was alone in his party....For four years, Republicans in Congress have pursued a strategy of confrontation, refusal to compromise and obstruction...But despite historic levels of obstruction, President Obama was able to bring the economy back from the verge of a second Great Depression...President Obama and Democrats are working tirelessly to move our country forward over the near unanimous opposition of Republican leaders and Republican members of Congress. The decision we have to make this November is simple: do we keep moving forward, or do we join the Romney-Ryan retreat and go back to the same failed policies of the past?\" Politico.\n\n@thegarance: Van Hollen confirming my thesis on Mid-Atlantic pols.

We've tried trickle-down tax cuts for the wealthy and 'anything goes' for big corporations. We tried it under a president who billed himself as a 'compassionate conservative.' It didn't work. Now we have Mitt Romney, calling himself a 'severe conservative.'...Romney not only wants to make those tax cuts permanent, he wants to add more tax breaks for the wealthy that would make our deficit even bigger...Some say Romney would repeat the past.

Barbara Mikulski on women \"We work on macro issues and macaroni and cheese issues. When women are in the halls of power, our national debate reflects the needs and dreams of American families. Women leading means that Congress is working to create jobs, make quality child care more affordable and strengthen the middle class because we understand that America grows the economy and opportunity from the middle out, not the top down.

That ideal is written into our laws, the rules of the road that create a level playing field in this country. Those are the rules I became attorney general to uphold. And those are the rules Mitt Romney would have us roll back...[W]e've all seen what happens when you roll back those rules. What happens are rows of foreclosure signs. What happens are mountains of family debt. What happens is a middle class that's hurting.\" Politico.\n\nSBA Administrator Karen Mills on small business. \"President Obama understands that small businesses are the backbone of our economy...They create two-thirds of all new jobs. Small businesses are a big part of who we are.\n\n When President Obama took office, the economy was in free-fall. Credit was frozen. Small businesses weren't thinking about expansion; they were thinking about survival. The president knew that one of the most important things he could do was give small businesses a fighting chance. So, he took action...Today, small business owners are having very different conversations than they were three-and-a-half years ago. Today, they're talking about strategies to fill larger orders, blueprints for bigger factories, and plans to hire more workers...President Obama has delivered for them. He understands that Washington doesn't create jobs; small businesses do.

About budgets... Bill Clinton made the policy case for Barack Obama. Neither Paul Ryan nor anyone else at the Republican convention made a sustained policy case for Mitt Romney. In that way, Clinton’s speech fit neatly into the emergent Democratic strategy to be, in this election, the party of policy. To be sure, they don’t have much of a choice...The most of important of these was his commentary on Medicaid...First, it’s a direct attack on Romney and Ryan’s claim that their budget won’t harm any seniors over age 55...Second, it’s an inarguable attack on Romney and Ryan’s budgets...Third, it’s arguably the most important and concrete policy difference between the two campaigns...Tonight, his role was wonk-in-chief, and he was trying to persuade the public of an old idea: That the best way to understand this election is to simply do the arithmetic.\" Ezra Klein in The Washington Post.\n\n@jbarro: Bill Clinton hitting Republicans for their Medicaid plan. Why does nobody talk about this? It's more important than the Medicare stuff.\n\nMARANISS: What makes Clinton magic. \"Twelve years out of office but still and always ready to be needed, he took to prime time as master explainer and policy clarifier, party morale booster extraordinaire, voice of experience, historian longing for the old days of political bipartisanship, earnest economics instructor, hoarse whisperer to the middle class, and empathetic testifier for President Obama...Even as his speech went on and on toward the 48-minute mark, blasting way past his allotted time, Clinton did not seem rambling so much as direct and fast and eager...In classic Clinton style, the more he got going, the less inclined he was to follow his printed text, ad-libbing his way through a series of knowing asides such as, 'I know; I get it; I’ve been there.' He took his listeners on a kaleidoscopic tour of recent political history and deep into the Clintonian method, a modern-day variation of the Socratic method in which every question is worthy of consideration, and every opposing argument is given its due before being shredded.\" David Maraniss in The Washington Post.\n\n@jodikantor: Clinton finally has his long-sought chance to be Obama's communications director.\n\nROSENTHAL: Clinton's hour of needed. \"Watching Bill Clinton take the stage at the Democratic National Convention and take over the room with his first few, simple words -- 'We are here to nominate a President and I’ve got one in mind' -- was like watching a great violinist follow a group of gifted amateurs. His commanding presence, his let’s-just-chat manner, the familiar sound of his southern growl were the perfect counterpoint to the Republican Party’s assault on President Obama at its convention in Tampa last week. He skewered the Republicans gently, biting his lower-lip in characteristic fashion. He spoke more in sorrow than in anger...He fed the audience a string of statistics -- about job creation and health care reform and Medicare and Medicaid -- so smoothly that no one seemed to notice they were listening to an unusually policy-focused speech...This was his perfect moment.\" Andrew Rosenthal in The New York Times.\n\nWILL: The radical content of Obama's speech tomorrow night. \"Four years ago, Barack Obama was America’s Rorschach test, upon whom voters could project their disparate yearnings. To govern, however, is to choose, and now his choices have clarified him.

Instead, the costs of all the hospitalizations, office visits, tests and treatments will be rolled into one 'episode-based' or 'bundled' payment...This is how it will work: Medicaid and private insurers will identify the doctor or hospital who is primarily responsible for the patient’s care — the 'quarterback,' as Andrew Allison, the state’s Medicaid director, put it.\" Ezekiel J. Emanuel in The New York Times.\n\nBLINDER: Out in far-right field. \"Mitt Romney embraced an economic vision that differs radically from the rough politico-economic consensus in the United States since Franklin Roosevelt. Barack Obama accepts that broad consensus and, like many other presidents, has sought to deepen it. The Rooseveltian consensus embodied three main elements: a modest social safety net to protect vulnerable Americans from some of the downsides of unfettered markets, Keynesian-style policies to shorten recessions, and a progressive tax-transfer system to mitigate income inequality...But with Messrs.

Who aspires for their children to become economic or military resources? Dewey had a different vision. Given the pace of change, it is impossible (he noted in 1897) to know what the world will be like in a couple of decades, so schools first and foremost should teach us habits of learning. For Dewey, these habits included awareness of our interdependence; nobody is an expert on everything. He emphasized 'plasticity,' an openness to being shaped by experience.\" Michael S.

Kristof in The New York Times.\n\nSteve Luxenberg writes about Bob Woodwards lates book, 'The Price of Politics':\"A combination of miscalculations, ideological rigidity and discord within the leadership of both political parties brought the U.S. government to the brink of a catastrophic default during the 2011 showdown over the federal debt ceiling, according to a new book by journalist Bob Woodward...As the nation’s leaders raced to avert a default that could have shattered the financial markets’ confidence and imperiled the world’s economy, Obama convened an urgent meeting with top congressional leaders in the White House. According to Woodward, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) pointedly told the president that the lawmakers were working on a plan and wouldn’t negotiate with him. Obama, surprised, told Boehner and the others that they could not exclude him from the process, Woodward reports...Congress’s reemergence as a political force is one of the book’s underlying themes. For decades, Capitol Hill has been ceding influence and authority to the White House, especially to presidents who were bent on expanding the powers of the executive branch. In Woodward’s account, the balance of power has shifted at least temporarily back to the legislative branch during the past two years, aided by the Obama administration’s failure to nurture the alliances that it needed to offset the GOP’s huge victory in the 2010 midterm elections.\"\n\nCoronal mass ejection interlude: A burst of solar plasma makes for as cool as a Youtube video as it sounds.

Georgetown law student and Obama supporter Sandra Fluke will take to the stage. But all of that is being overshadowed by a bombshell reversal of the DNC platform as the party has re-inserted references to God and Jerusalem.\n\nNow, you may recall that earlier this week, delegates approved a platform that p President personally intervene today in order to halt the proceedings and have that language reinstated.\n\nHowever, that task was far from easy, because when the convention chair held a voice vote to authorize the amendment, he couldn't seem to win over the two-thirds majority that he needed. Watch this.\n\nMAYOR ANTONIO VILLARAIGOSA, D-LOS ANGELES: All those delegates in favor, say aye.\n\nAll those delegates opposed, say no.\n\nIn the opinion of the -- let me do that again.\n\nAll of those delegates in favor say aye.\n\nAll those delegates opposed say no.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: You got to let them do what they are going to do.\n\nVILLARAIGOSA: I'll do that one more time. All those delegates in favor, say aye.\n\nAll those delegates opposed say no.\n\nIn the opinion of the chair, two-thirds have voted in the affirmative, the motion is adopted and the platform has been amended as shown on the screen.\n\nHANNITY: Now, despite the fact that a clear majority did not vote to approve the change, the Los Angeles Mayor went ahead with it anyway. And here's why. Because in his teleprompter, the script was already loaded, ordering him to declare that, quote, \"In the opinion of the chair, two- thirds having voted in the affirmative.\"\n\nWe are going to continue all of this and continue the coverage right here on \"Hannity\" tonight. But first, let me welcome the Reverend Jesse Jackson of Rainbow PUSH. Reverend, how are you? Good to see you.\n\nREV. JESSE JACKSON, RAINBOW PUSH: Good to see you, sir.\n\nHANNITY: Will this be the convention that we will now remember as the time that God was nay'd and boo'd by the Democratic National Convention?\n\nJACKSON: I think, what I really think is that Jesus at one point says, lord (ph) is not the issue. It is not the name of God, it's the will that's at stake here. And that means that we must focus not just on whether we name god, Ali, Allah, Yaweh, Aluwen (ph) but we feed the hungry.\n\nHANNITY: All right. But we are not talking about feeding the hungry. What we are talking about is the Democratic Party today boo'd and boo'd loudly and that they had three separate times they boo'd, obviously a majority wanting it to stay the same with God taken out and with Jerusalem being the capital of Israel taken out. I mean, that is a reaction that the country has taken note of, Reverend.\n\nJACKSON: Well, you know, I am not sure why some people would want to focus on the word God versus Ali, Allah or Yaweh, Aluwen (ph). Because it is not the name God that makes one religious, it is the will of God that makes one religious. And I think that must be what make --\n\nHANNITY: We are endowed by our creator, our founding document. We are endowed by our creator. It was in the 2008 platform, it was seven times in the 2004 platform. They purposely took it out. The delegates wanted to keep it out you. How should America interpret that?\n\nJACKSON: Maybe it should have been the real creator in the first place. I've gone to schools where you have 50 different languages and several different religions, and so the issue of a religion and a name can be quite divisive a multi-cultural society.\n\nHANNITY: All right. Yes. What about the fact that in spite of the overwhelming majority of delegates, you know, going against this, that the chair, after three votes -- and you could hear the loud nos, why did they go ahead and move forward anyway? Did they not -- basically ramming this down their throat, whether they wanted it or not?\n\nJACKSON: Well, he had to make a choice and he finally made a choice --\n\nJACKSON: Well, I am not sure if against the people, it was a very close vote, I'm not sure if it was two-thirds --\n\nHANNITY: It was not close to two-thirds.\n\nJACKSON: Well, giving all that is happening in this convention, I think that will now be determine in fact, I think what might determine, the outcome, is we came in four years ago with eight million jobs down, now four million jobs up -- that jobs might determine how people find their --\n\nHANNITY: Reverend, with all due respect, since the time Barack Obama has been president, we have hundreds of thousands fewer Americans working. If you look at the number of Americans working back when he took office in January of 2009 and today, we have fewer Americans working. He said he would cut the deficit in half, and he gave us $5.4 trillion in new Obama debt.\n\nJACKSON: And more people are working. And more manufacturers at home. We lost eight million jobs in eight years.\n\nJACKSON: Four to eight million. And the trajectory was down. We have a net gain of jobs for 36 months.\n\nHANNITY: We have the longest period -- if you want to look at the statistics, Reverend. We have the longest period of long-time unemployment that we've had since World War II. I will give you another --\n\nJACKSON: What drove us into that crisis? We're in on a surplus. And we made a decision to have two wars off budget and cut taxes.\n\nHANNITY: That was in the Bush years.\n\nJACKSON: But having said that, this is connected and those tax cuts was not linked to -- reinvestment. So, you got two wars that you are paying for own credit and no investment at home. It sunk our economy.\n\nHANNITY: Didn't President Obama, then candidate Obama say, he said, he cut the deficit in half. He has given us the largest deficits by far than any president in history. He said he would create shovel-ready jobs, fewer Americans are working. So, how do you answer the question? On the economy, how are we better off than we were four years ago?\n\nJACKSON: Well, we are better off -- if you ask all the workers who are going out of the backdoor, who are now working three shifts in Ohio, they would say it's\n\nJACKSON: But they were completely out of business. If you are going to ask those who have health coverage who didn't have it before, are they better off, they would tend to say yes. If you ask those students who got (INAUDIBLE) who couldn't afford to stay in school, they will say that we're better off. One hundred thousand troops in Iraq who are home now, they are better off.\n\nHANNITY: Let me ask you this. When Bill Clinton four years ago said that Barack Obama played the race card on him and the mayor of Los Angeles said about the Republican Party, that you can't trot out a brown face or a Spanish surname and Joe Biden says, \"They are going to put you back in chains.\" And Bill Clinton is going to speak here tonight saying, Barack Obama not only played the race card against him but he planned to do it in the very beginning. You hear these racial statements. You have been outspoken on the issue of race in this country. Does that disturb you that the race card has been played and is being played?\n\nJACKSON: Well, I think when you call the president a liar --\n\nJACKSON: Well, and it's never right. When you call him un-American, you are not born here, you are not a Christian, you are not one of us --\n\nHANNITY: Who said those things?\n\nJACKSON: Well, you know what the language is. Whether it's used by the birther argument, by Trump or the welfare -- know the roll call.\n\nHANNITY: Obama called in July of 2008, he said George Bush was unpatriotic.\n\nJACKSON: I am not sure what he meant by that.\n\nHANNITY: He said George Bush on the debt is irresponsible and unpatriotic for four trillion in eight years in debt, and he gave us $5.4 trillion in less than four years.\n\nJACKSON: Well, I am not sure that is the definition of a patriot. And sometimes language gets real loose. But I do know is that our economy is coming back. I do know our troops are coming home. I do know that more Americans have health coverage now. And to me, those arrows are pointing in the right direction.\n\nHANNITY: We are going to hear from Sandra Fluke in a minute. The contraceptive mandate. You are a minister. Should taxpayers pay for contraception and abortion for people that want them on demand?\n\nJACKSON: Sure, they should.\n\nHANNITY: Free abortion? The government should pay for abortion.\n\nJACKSON: Well, first, it was a woman's right to set the termination -- it is a health issue. And to reduce it just to a moral issue and not take into account many social considerations, I think is very --\n\nHANNITY: Even Catholic charities, Catholic hospitals, should give contraception even though they it is against their faith?\n\nJACKSON: Well, we live under faith, we live under the law. When you're taking government money, you live under the Constitution --\n\nHANNITY: It's not freedom of -- well, the Constitution is about freedom of religion.\n\nJACKSON: We live in our faith. Maybe, we live under the Constitution. We don't live on the Bible. I am strongly committed to our Bible, I've been -- but we live, fortunately, on the constitution.\n\nHANNITY: All right. Keep hope alive.\n\nJACKSON: Same to you.\n\nHANNITY: All right. Thank you, Rev. --\n\nHANNITY: -- for stopping by. I appreciate it.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC.

But she saw her daughter become the first in her family to graduate from college. And my mother fought hard for civil rights so that instead of a mop, I could hold this microphone.”\n\nThe speech didn’t have quite the seismic impact of Obama’s keynote at the 2004 Democratic Convention in Boston, but many observers said it came as close to that mark as anyone has since.\n\n“Mayor Castro? … I think a star was born,” Fox News commentator Kristen Powers said. “I think he did a great speech. You can’t compare it favorably necessarily to Obama’s [2004] speech which was a much more soaring speech when he gave it, but technically it’s very, very astute. It hit the points. And there was a lot about American exceptionalism in there, all throughout the speech.”\n\nTexas delegate Brian Hamon, a member of the state party’s executive committee, said Castro’s personal story resonated with his audience.\n\n“It’s such a long journey to try and bring your family up from poverty, Castro’s statement about how it’s a relay, not a marathon, it almost made me cry,” said Hamon, who is from Williamson County. “I foresee a whole generation of politicians inspired by Julian.”\n\n“Julian definitely is in the mix,” Bullard said. “I’d love to see him run for governor of Texas.”\n\nSpeaking from his own experience, Castro paid tribute to the value of hard work and family. He underscored the Democratic Party message by stressing the role of the broader community in giving the less-well-off a chance to succeed.\n\n“In Texas, we believe in the rugged individual,” Castro said to loud applause from his home state delegation. “Texas may be the one place where people actually still have bootstraps, and we expect folks to pull themselves up by them. But we also recognize there are some things we can’t do alone. We have to come together and invest in opportunity today for prosperity tomorrow.”\n\nDuring his 20-minute speech, Castro argued that most of those who aren’t moving up the economic ladder are stuck due to a lack of opportunity, not a lack of personal effort.\n\nAs he talked about privilege and poverty, Castro’s not so subtle message was that Romney couldn’t relate to the struggles of the poor and middle class. The mayor also took direct aim at Romney’s economic proposals.\n\n“Republicans tell us that if the most prosperous among us do even better, that somehow the rest of us will, too. Folks, we’ve heard that before. First, they called it ‘trickle-down.’ Then, ‘supply-side.’ Now it’s ‘Romney-Ryan.’ Or is it ‘Ryan-Romney’? Either way, their theory has been tested. It failed. Our economy failed. The middle class paid the price. Your family paid the price. Mitt Romney just doesn’t get it,” Castro said.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:53:37.584-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:53:37.584-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/04/politics/julian-castro-profile/index.html", "title" : "Rising star in Democratic Party first Latino to deliver keynote address", "text" : "Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN) -- A young rising star. A keynote speech on the Democratic Party's biggest stage. Is it 2004 again?\n\nSan Antonio Mayor Julian Castro gave the most significant speech of his political career on Tuesday night when he became the first Latino to deliver the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention.\n\n\"My grandmother didn't live to see us begin our lives in public service. But she probably would've thought it extraordinary that just two generations after she arrived in San Antonio, one grandson would be the mayor and the other would be on his way -- the good people of San Antonio willing -- to the United States Congress,\" Castro said in his speech, referring to his twin brother, Joaquin.\n\n\"My family's story isn't special. What's special is the America that makes our story possible. \"Ours is a nation like no other -- a place where great journeys can be made in a single generation ... no matter who you are or where you come from, the path is always forward.\"\n\nComparisons to the 2004 Barack Obama are inevitable. The then-Illinois state Sen. Obama gave the same address in Boston, launching him onto the fast track for the presidential nomination four years later.\n\nCastro, 37, shrugs off the similarities and talk that he could eventually become the first Hispanic president.\n\n\"Oh, I would be lying if I said that's not flattering. Of course it's flattering to anybody,\" he said last week from San Antonio. \"But the biggest mistake I can make in this situation is to believe the press, to believe the hype.\"\n\nThat humble response can be attributed to his modest upbringing.\n\nCastro's grandmother immigrated to Texas from Mexico as an orphan at the age of six. She taught herself to read and write in Spanish, eventually finding work in San Antonio as a maid and a cook.\n\nCastro's mother, Rosie Castro, learned a tough lesson at a young age while in school in San Antonio, where her teachers discouraged speaking Spanish.\n\n\"They would charge us a quarter if you were caught speaking Spanish, and incidentally that's how much lunch cost,\" Rosie Castro said. \"We were put down so often that the message was clear -- Spanish was a bad language that shouldn't be spoken.\"\n\nAs a result, Julian Castro and his brother, Joaquin, grew up in a home where Spanish was rarely spoken. Neither speaks the language fluently.\n\n\"I understand Spanish better than I speak it,\" Julian Castro admits.\n\nIt was Rosie Castro who inspired Julian's political future. While in college she became president of the Young Democrats at Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio. Out of college, she joined the Chicano movement, working with the \"La Raza Unida Party\" to fight for reforms beneficial to the Mexican-American community.\n\nIn 1971, Rosie ran for San Antonio City Council and lost the race. Along the way, though, she took her sons to various community and political events where they witnessed battles for voting rights and an end to discrimination on city services.\n\n\"I dragged them to every meeting, rally and voting booth,\" Rosie Castro said. \"They helped me on different campaigns and handed out literature. I wanted them to realize it is your duty to be involved.\"\n\nNow, less than two weeks shy of his 38th birthday, Julian Castro, a graduate of Stanford University and Harvard's Law School, is the youngest mayor of a Top 50 American city. At age 26, he was the youngest councilman ever elected in San Antonio. Joaquin Castro, who introduced his twin Tuesday night, is a politician in his own right -- currently running for the House of Representatives in a contest Democratic leaders expect him to win.\n\n\"Since they were young, I imagined they would do great things,\" Rosie Castro said of her sons.\n\nA source familiar with Julian Castro's speech set the bar high for the San Antonio mayor, saying it was akin to Obama's career-making 2004 address.\n\nCastro himself says he'll focus on his own story of achieving the American dream.\n\nWho is the next Obama?\n\nHe drew a link for those working to write their own success story, addressing what he said in an interview was the \"clear choice that voters have in this election, and why the policies that President Obama has put forth make more sense to creating opportunity, bringing the middle class back, and assuring prosperity in the future.\"\n\n\"We need to make a choice. It's a choice ... between a country where the middle class pays more, so that millionaires can pay less ... or a country where everybody pays their fair share. It's a choice between a nation that slashes funding for our schools and guts Pell grants ... or a nation that invests more in education. It's a choice between a politician who rewards companies that ship American jobs overseas ... or a leader who brings jobs back home,\" Castro said.\n\n\"This is the choice before us. And to me, to my generation, and for all the generations that will come after us, our choice is clear. Our choice is a man who's always chosen us. A man who already is our president -- Barack Obama.\"\n\nThe choice of Castro for the convention's keynote address is strategic in an election where the Latino vote will be key.\n\nObama handily won the demographic's vote in 2008 over Republican John McCain and it will be pivotal for him to do the same in November.\n\nThe Romney campaign also knows the importance of Hispanic voters. Last week's GOP convention in Tampa had no shortage of prominent Latino speakers, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American who was among those in consideration for Romney's vice presidential pick.\n\nObama's advantage over Romney among the politically imperative demographic remains steady from previous months, with the president taking 61% to Romney's 29% of registered Latino voters' support in August, according to a Gallup survey.\n\nRomney's campaign has publicly identified a \"magic number\" for the Latino vote if the former Massachusetts governor has a chance of winning the election: 38%. McCain garnered 31% of the Latino vote in 2008.\n\nBut Latino interest in the 2012 election appears to be lagging. Compared with the 2008 election cycle, Hispanic interest levels in 2012 are 10 points behind where they were in the previous election, according to an NBC-Wall Street Journal-Telemundo poll conducted in July.\n\nAmid the lagging support, the White House announced in June a bold new policy that halts deportations of some young immigrants who came to America illegally as children. The policy is a \"temporary\" measure that allows eligible immigrants to apply for work permits and deportation deferral for a two-year period.\n\nCastro acknowledges with a smile the strategy behind his prominent speaking role: \"Obviously I'm young and I'm also Hispanic, two important groups in this election. And I'm confident that I can do a good job in articulating why President Obama ought to be the candidate that Americans select for the next four years.\"\n\nSince being elected in 2009, Castro has built a reputation as \"a youthful and dynamic leader here in town,\" says Walter Wilson, assistant professor of political science at the University of Texas-San Antonio.\n\n\"In a lot of ways, this speech is an initial test on the national stage,\" Wilson says, predicting that if Castro is successful at the convention, it gives the party a new confidence that he indeed is a rising Democratic star.\n\n\"It's definitely a symbolically significant speech for the mayor. It sets the tone for where the Democratic Party thinks its future is headed,\" Wilson said.\n\nSan Antonio Republicans are skeptical of Castro's broader appeal, with one San Antonio official calling him a \"typical young, energetic liberal Democrat.\"\n\nHe \"believes in big government, tax and spend, and those type of things,\" said Steve Heinrich, treasurer of the Republican Party of Bexar County.\n\nGeorge Rodriguez, president of the Tea Party of San Antonio, echoed those comments.\n\n\"He's a tax-and-spend liberal. He does not represent all Hispanics, we're not all the same,\" Rodriguez said.\n\nBefore his speech, the young mayor Tuesday appeared to be more nervous about using a teleprompter for only the second time rather than for the high expectations surrounding his address.\n\n\"In the end, the American dream is not a sprint, or even a marathon, but a relay,\" Castro said. \"Our families don't always cross the finish line in the span of one generation. But each generation passes on to the next the fruits of their labor. My grandmother never owned a house. She cleaned other people's houses so she could afford to rent her own. But she saw her daughter become the first in her family to graduate from college. And my mother fought hard for civil rights so that instead of a mop, I could hold this microphone.\"\n\nSarah Aarthun reported from Charlotte, Ed Lavandera from San Antonio and Mariano Castillo from Atlanta.

Barack knows the American dream because he’s lived it, and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we’re from, or what we look like, or who we love.”\n\nFour years of partisan sniping, Washington gridlock and continued economic challenges may have dulled the luster of the man this party nominated four years ago. But Mrs. Obama sought to remind his 2008 voters that the same person they supported then is underneath the tarnish she sought to buff away.\n\nThe address was meant to lay the foundation for a convention program devised to remind wavering working- and middle-class voters — the same ones Mr. Romney is working so hard to woo away — what they liked about the president when they supported him four years ago, and how his own humbler roots have helped inspire his policies to help them.\n\n“He believes that when you’ve worked hard, and done well, and walked through that doorway of opportunity, you do not slam it shut behind you,” Mrs. Obama said, her impassioned delivery drawing the crowd to its feet as it waved red, white and blue “Michelle” placards. “You reach back, and you give other folks the same chances that helped you succeed.”\n\nIt was one of the few times Mrs. Obama came close to even a subtle reference to the very direct argument being made against her husband’s opponent here. She argued that Mr. Obama’s experience as president had taught him that “no amount of data or numbers will get you the right answer.” Her portrait of her husband was the inverse of the one that other Democrats have sketched of Mr. Romney, who former Gov. Ted Strickland of Ohio said viewed the “American worker” as “just numbers on a spreadsheet.”\n\nAs someone with whom she was “so young, so in love, and so in debt,” Mrs. Obama said, her husband believes “success isn’t about how much money you make. It’s about the difference you make in people’s lives.”\n\nMrs. Obama’s was almost the only voice lacking an explicit anti-Romney edge, conveying a personal tone and touch after speeches that were personal in a different way when it came to the president’s opponent. As the other speakers undertook a program that amounted to a thundering response to the Republican convention last week in Tampa, Fla., they went after Mr. Romney on just about every conceivable issue.\n\nThe keynote speaker, Mayor Julián Castro of San Antonio, offered the overarching argument against Mr. Romney and his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.\n\n“Their theory has been tested. It failed. Our economy failed,” Mr. Castro said in what seemed to be the second-most rousing speech of the night for the Democratic audience. “The middle class paid the price. Your family paid the price. Mitt Romney just doesn’t get it.”\n\nAfter what has at times been a tentative approach to promoting the health care law, perhaps Mr. Obama’s signature legislation, the program included a full-throated defense of the overhaul and the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold it.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:53:39.347-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:53:39.347-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://cincinnati.com/blogs/politics/2012/09/04/doug-stern-transcript-of-dnc-speech/", "title" : "Doug Stern: Transcript of DNC Speech", "text" : "Cincinnati firefighter Doug Stern addressed the thousands gathered in Charlotte for the Democratic National Convention. Here’s exactly what he said, according to a transcript from the Obama campaign:\n\nHello. My name is Doug Stern. I’m an Ohio firemen, an unlikely choice to be addressing you this evening. For the vast majority of my voting life, I have been a Republican. So why am I here? Something has happened recently — the Republican party left people like me. As a member of the middle-class, that left me and they certainly left me as a public employee.\n\nSomewhere along the way, being a public employee, someone who works for my community, made a scapegoat to the GOP. Vice-President Biden and President Obama still believe public service is an honorable calling.\n\nWhen I go to work, when there is an emergency, I want someone on my crew that has my back, someone that helps me get the job done, someone that is willing to go through hell with me, and I expect the same out of my elected leaders. That is what we get with Joe Biden and Barack Obama.\n\nFor maintaining grant programs so fire departments nationwide have the save staffing and equipment to support our people that President Obama and Vice- President Biden had our backs. Supporting my voice, the have collectivegaining on the jobs, President Obama has my back. President Obama has kept thousands of first responders on the job and he sent plans to Congress to keep even more of is Republicans must stop obstructing progress and do the right thing for the middle- class. They must pass the President’s jobs plan. For me, this election is about who respects middle-class workers like me and my family. I saw firsthand what the Republicans thought of me and my fellow public employees last year when Ohio legislators passed Senate Bill 5 in an attempt to silence us. We all know how that went. While they were not successful cutting our collective bargaining rights, they were successful in cutting funding for cities and towns all across ohio. We have watched these so-called leaders claim they did not raise taxes, all the while knowing full well they are forcing the local governments to raise taxes or cut essential services, including police and fire. We have the very right to voice our concerns about safety matters not just for ourselves, the general public we protect as well when right wing extremists try to take away the ability to negotiate with so-called right to work laws. But let me tell you what else we feel — we feel unified and we feel stronger than ever. We have seen the people of Ohio are on to their parlor tricks. Last year, 63% of ohio voters took a stand with public employees. They’ve rejected the governors’ Senate Bill 5. They said enough. The voters this year have the opportunity to do the same all across the country. Enough of the vilification of the people who work for a living. Enough of the disrespect of the middle-class. Enough of the far right agenda. If we have a clear choice this campaign. The people I work with, the firemen I hang out with, we have a simple statement — we support those who support us. That is why this Republican — former Republican firemen stands here before you today. And that is why firefighters support President Obama and Vice President Biden, because they have our backs and it’s our turn to have theirs. Thank you.

Yet she pressed on, delivering the most poignant message heard yet about the significance to individuals of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nShe told the crowd that on the day the US supreme court had upheld Obamacare, \"like so many moms with sick children, I shed tears and I could breathe easier knowing we have that net below us to catch us if we fall, or if, God forbid, Zoe needs a heart transplant.\" Then she added: \"Obamacare provides my family security and relief.\"\n\nZoe has already had open-heart surgery twice and faces a third operation either next year or the year after. Yet Zoe's parents had been told by their health insurers that their child had hit her \"lifetime cap\" – in other words the maximum had been spent on her and she would receive no more coverage.\n\nWith devastating effect, Lihn turned the story around and directed it against Mitt Romney. She quoted back at him one of his key lines in his address at the Republican convention in Tampa last week, that \"you know there's something wrong with the kind of job [Obama's] done as president when the best feeling you had was the day you voted for him.\"\n\n\"But that's not true. Not even close,\" Lihn said. \"There was the day the letter arrived from the insurance company, saying that our daughter's lifetime cap had been lifted. There was the day the supreme court upheld Obamacare.\"\n\nAnd to drum the point home, Lihn said that her family remained scared that should Romney win the race for the White House, he would repeal the healthcare reforms and Zoe would once again hit her lifetime cap.

The Palestinian nation, like any other nation, has the right to determine their own destiny and elect the governing system of the country.”\n\nAlmost unnoticed, Iran this week joined the United States and Israel as one of the few countries in the world to oppose the statehood bid at the United Nations by the Palestinians. As the Tehran Times noted, the Iranian supreme leader “condemned any measure which would lead to the recognition of the Israeli regime and would ignore the legal right of the Palestinian people to their homeland.”\n\nIn other words, Iran continues to oppose the two-state solution. But does this mean that Iran wants to destroy Israel — “wipe it off the map” — as is commonly cited? This is certainly the conventional wisdom, as seen in the statements above. But a colleague at The Washington Post, spotting the Bachmann and Obama statements during the U.N. festivities last month, suggested that this widely cited statement by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was actually a mistranslation.\n\nThe firestorm started when Nazila Fathi, then the Tehran correspondent of The New York Times, reported a story almost six years ago that was headlined: “Wipe Israel ‘off the map’ Iranian says.” The article attributed newly elected Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s remarks to a report by the ISNA press agency.\n\nThe article sparked outrage around the globe, with then-President George W. Bush and other world leaders condemning Ahmadinejad’s statement. The original New York Times article noted that Ahmadinejad said he was quoting Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the Islamic revolution, but that aspect was largely overlooked.\n\nThen, specialists such as Juan Cole of the University of Michigan and Arash Norouzi of the Mossadegh Project pointed out that the original statement in Persian did not say that Israel should be wiped from the map, but instead that it would collapse.\n\nCole said this week that in the 1980s Khomeini gave a speech in which he said in Persian “Een rezhim-i eshghalgar-i Quds bayad az sahneh-i ruzgar mahv shaved.” This means, “This occupation regime over Jerusalem must vanish from the arena of time.” But then anonymous wire service translators rendered Khomeini as saying that Israel “must be wiped off the face of the map,” which Cole and Nourouzi say is inaccurate.\n\nAhmadinejad slightly misquoted Khomeini, substituting “safheh-i ruzgar,” or “page of time\" for \"sahneh-i ruzgar\" or “arena of time.” But in any case, the old translation was dug up and used again by the Iranian news agency, Cole says. In fact, that’s how it was presented for years on Ahmadinejad’s English-language Web site, as the Times noted in a somewhat defensive article on the translation debate.\n\nBut the story doesn’t end there. Karim Sadjadpour, an Iranian specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, notes that Iranian government entities began to erect billboards and signs with the “wipe off” phrase in English. Joshua Teitelbaum of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs compiled an interesting collection of photographs of these banners, such as one on the building that houses reserve military forces of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. “Israel should be wiped out of the face of the world,” the sign reads in English.\n\nTeitelbaum’s report, while written from a pro-Israel perspective, includes a number of threatening statements about Israel that are similar in tone to Ahmadinejad’s controversial statement.\n\nIn 2000, Khamenei stated, “Iran’s position, which was first expressed by the Imam [Khomeini] and stated several times by those responsible, is that the cancerous tumor called Israel must be uprooted from the region.” He went on to say in the same speech that “Palestinian refugees should return and Muslims, Christians and Jews could choose a government for themselves, excluding immigrant Jews.”\n\nSadjadpour, who has closely studied the statements of Khamenei, said that the supreme leader has spoken more on the question of Israel than any other issue, which is remarkable given that Iran shares no border with Israel and that the Jewish state has virtually no impact on the daily lives of Iranians. Sadjadpour said Khamenei has been consistent, stating repeatedly that the goal is not the military destruction of the Jewish state but “the defeat of Zionist ideology and the dissolution of Israel through a ‘popular referendum.’”\n\nOf course, an Israeli might conclude that such an outcome would be the destruction of the Jewish state in any case.\n\nSome might question why Ahmadinejad’s precise words are important. Clearly, the Iranian government has unrelenting opposition to the state of Israel, so much so that it even rejects Palestinian efforts at statehood if that would result in Israel remaining in the Middle East. Indeed, Tehran has armed and funded Hamas, Hezbollah and other militant groups opposed to Israel. At the same time, the words allegedly uttered by Ahmadinejad have been used to suggest a change toward a more militaristic posture by Iran toward Israel.\n\nIn fact, Ahmadinejad is not the power broker in Iran; it is Khamenei. Khamenei, in fact, has been consistent in speaking of his hatred of Israel, but without a military context, as he demonstrated once again this week. Moreover, the fact that Ahmadinejad was merely quoting Khomeini suggests that even less weight should have been given to his words, especially since there is a dispute over the precise meaning in English.\n\n“Wipe off the map,” in other words, has become easy shorthand for expressing revulsion at Iran’s anti-Israeli foreign policy. Certainly attention needs to be focused on that — and Iranian behavior in the region. But we’re going to award a Pinocchio to everyone — including ourselves — who has blithely repeated the phrase without putting it into context.\n\nFollow the Fact Checker on Twitter and friend us on Facebook", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:53:46.199-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:53:46.199-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/09/18/us-iran-idUSTRE58H17S20090918", "title" : "Ahmadinejad says Holocaust a lie, Israel has no future", "text" : "\"The pretext (Holocaust) for the creation of the Zionist regime (Israel) is false ...

Do not tie your fate to it ... This regime has no future.

We will continue to confront it decisively in the future,\" Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said.\n\nWhite House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Ahmadinejad's comment \"only serves to isolate Iran further from the world.\"\n\nAhmadinejad won support from Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, leader of Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah which fought a 34-day war with Israel in 2006. \"Our belief and creed ... remain that Israel is an illegal entity, a cancerous tumor, that must cease to exist,\" Nasrallah said in a televised address.\n\nAhmadinejad will appear next week at the United Nations General Assembly and Tehran will hold talks on October 1 with major powers worried about the Islamic Republic's nuclear strategy.\n\nWestern powers are concerned by what they have called Tehran's defiance and \"point-blank refusal\" to suspend uranium enrichment and address the issue as demanded by U.N. Security Council resolutions since 2006.\n\nInstead of directly addressing those demands, Iran handed world powers this month a proposal that spoke generally of talks on political, security, international and economic issues but was silent on its nuclear program.\n\nDiplomats familiar with the Iranian proposal said it was vague and did not appear to pass \"the smell test.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said it was time Iran showed it is serious about addressing international concern. \"There will be accompanying costs for Iran's continued defiance: more isolation and economic pressure,\" she said.\n\nAhmadinejad repeated Thursday that Iran would \"never\" abandon its disputed nuclear program to appease critics.\n\nIn an NBC-TV interview, he also offered no direct response when asked whether there were any conditions under which Iran would develop a nuclear weapon.\n\n\"We don't need nuclear weapons,\" Ahmadinejad said, speaking through an interpreter. \"We do not see any need for such weapons. And the conditions around the world are moving to favor our ideas,\" he added.\n\nThe major powers suspect Iran's uranium enrichment program is a cover for developing nuclear weapons. Iran has repeatedly said it is enriching uranium only to generate electricity, not for fissile bomb material, although it has no nuclear power plants to use low-level enriched uranium.\n\nNext month's major powers talks with Iran offer no clear relief to Israel, which wants world powers to be prepared to penalize Iran's vulnerable energy imports but sees Russia and China blocking any such resolution at the U.N. Security Council.\n\nThe major powers, which include permanent U.N. Security Council members Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States as well as Germany, offered Iran trade and diplomatic incentives in 2006 in exchange for halt to uranium enrichment.\n\nThey improved the offer last year but retained the demand that Iran suspend uranium enrichment, something Tehran has ruled out as a precondition.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, who came to office pledging to engage with Iran, has suggested Tehran may face harsher sanctions, possibly targeting its gasoline imports, if it does not accept good-faith talks by the end of September.\n\nBut Russia, which has veto power in the U.N. Security Council, last week ruled out oil sanctions against Iran.\n\nIran, the world's fifth-biggest crude producer, is seen as vulnerable to oil sanctions because it imports 40 percent of its gasoline to supply the cheap fuel Iranians see as a birthright.\n\nAt home, Ahmadinejad is facing strong opposition which erupted into unrest following his disputed re-election in June.\n\nFriday, Iranian security forces clashed with supporters of opposition leader Mirhossein Mousavi and arrested at least 10 of them during annual anti-Israel rallies in Tehran.\n\nThousands of supporters of Mousavi, wearing green wristbands or shawls, were among crowds marching in the \"Qods Day\" rallies.\n\nThe state news agency IRNA said Mousavi and reformist cleric Mehdi Karoubi, both defeated candidates in June, had been forced to leave the rallies after being attacked by \"angry people.\"\n\nReformist former president Mohammad Khatami took part in the rally, but was attacked by hardliners and had to leave after his robe was ripped and his turban fell to the ground, an ally of Khatami who accompanied him told Reuters.\n\nThe June vote, which was followed by huge opposition protests, plunged Iran into its worst political crisis in three decades and revealed deepening rifts within its ruling elites.\n\nOpposition leaders say the poll was rigged to secure Ahmadinejad's re-election. The authorities deny it.\n\nThe opposition says 70 people died during protests after the vote.

Andy Williams (L) gets a hug from Wayne Osmond during a 50th anniversary show at the Orleans hotel-casino in Las Vegas, Nevada in this August 13, 2007 file photo.\n\nThe blue-eyed Williams, who continued touring and drawing crowds to his Moon River Theater in the music hub of Branson into his 80s, died on Tuesday evening after a yearlong battle with bladder cancer, his family said in a statement.\n\nWilliams had 18 gold record and three platinum hits and in his peak years was a regular on television with his own variety series.\n\nWilliams was born on December 3, 1927, in tiny Wall Lake, Iowa, and was singing professionally with three older brothers at age 8. The Williams Brothers had steady work on radio and even sang back-up on Bing Crosby's 1944 hit \"Swinging on a Star.\"\n\nWilliams went solo after the group broke up in 1951, drew attention with his appearances on \"The Tonight Show\" and began recording. His first No. 1 hit, \"Butterfly,\" came in 1957.\n\nLater hits included \"Born Free,\" \"Days of Wine and Roses,\" \"The Shadow of Your Smile,\" \"Can't Get Used to Losing You,\" \"Solitaire,\" \"Music to Watch Girls By,\" \"Can't Take My Eyes Off of You\" and the theme from the 1970 movie hit \"Love Story.\"\n\nHe came upon his signature song when asked to sing Â\"Moon River\" at the 1962 Academy Awards ceremony. Audrey Hepburn had performed the song in the movie \"Breakfast at Tiffany's.\"\n\n\"I still love it, as many times as I've done it,\" Williams told a British newspaper in 2007. \"It has a great melody and wonderful lyrics. It's not a bad song to have. It could have been 'Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini.' We forgot to do it one night and 27 people wanted their money back.\"\n\nWilliams' first wife was Claudine Longet, a Folies Bergere dancer he married in 1961, and they had three children before divorcing. After their split, Williams supported Longet when she was charged with fatally shooting her boyfriend, skier Spider Sabich, in 1976 in Colorado. She was convicted of negligent homicide after claiming the gun went off accidentally.\n\nIn 1992, Williams built his own 2,000-seat dinner theater in Branson, a city of 10,000 people that had become a regional entertainment center featuring more than 30 theaters, most of which cater to country music acts. He performed there about 20 weeks a year while also putting on a Christmas tour in the United States and occasional tour of Britain.\n\nWilliams was a Christmas fixture on U.S. television, dressed casually in a trademark sweater, and he recorded several Christmas albums. In 2006 the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers ranked his \"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow\" as the sixth most frequently performed Christmas song and \"It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year\" as No. 11.\n\nWilliams had a strong following in Britain, where his career was revived in the late 1990s when Â\"Can't Take My Eyes Off of You\" and \"Music to Watch Girls By\" were used in television commercials.\n\nIn 1991, Williams married Debbie Haas and they lived in Branson and La Quinta, California.\n\nWilliams was a close friend of the powerful Kennedy political family and sang \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" at Robert F. Kennedy's funeral after the U.S. senator from New York was assassinated during the 1968 presidential campaign.\n\nWilliams' love of golf was so intense that for several years he hosted a professional tournament that bore his name.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:54:08.552-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:54:08.553-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/andy-williams-dies-moon-river-singer-was-84/2012/09/26/1bcabe46-c783-11e1-aa3a-f3dfb7ea106c_story.html", "title" : "Andy Williams, TV star and ‘Moon River’ singer, dies at 84", "text" : "Andy Williams, the silky-voiced, clean-cut crooner, whose hit recording of \"Moon River\" made him world famous, was a frequent performer on television and had his own variety show.\n\nMay 12, 1961 Andy Williams, the silky-voiced, clean-cut crooner, whose hit recording of \"Moon River\" made him world famous, was a frequent performer on television and had his own variety show. AP\n\nThe silky-voiced, clean-cut crooner, whose hit recording “Moon River” and years of popular Christmas TV shows brought him fans the world over, died Sept. 25.\n\nAndy Williams, whose languid crooning style and disarming presence propelled him to recording and television stardom in the 1960s, with hits including “Moon River” and the inescapable holiday jingle “It’s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year,” died Sept. 25 at his home in Branson, Mo. He was 84.\n\nHe died after a year-long battle with bladder cancer, his publicist, Paul Shefrin, said.\n\nMr. Williams’s entertainment career spanned eight decades, starting when he was an 8-year-old singer performing at church socials in his native Iowa. With his radiant smile, chiseled dimples and earnest personality, he conveyed an unfailingly wholesome image throughout his career — sometimes to his dismay. All too often, he wrote in his memoir, he was perceived as a “farm boy in a tuxedo.”\n\nThere was a seemingly effortless warmth in Mr. Williams’s tenor voice, but it was a hard-earned achievement after years of practice in small clubs and on the road. “You have to practice harder, because you’re not as good as the others out there,” his father had told him as a child. It stoked a lifelong desire to excel but also to please.\n\n“I still think I’m not as good as anybody else,” he told an interviewer as he approached retirement after a career in which he sold many millions of records.\n\nMr. Williams’s heyday spanned the life of his musical variety TV program, “The Andy Williams Show,” which aired on NBC from 1962 to 1967 and again from 1969 to 1971. The Christmas specials that spun off from the show ran for decades afterward, featuring celebrity carolers as well as members of the Williams family. The specials became television staples for generations of viewers and epitomized the season as much as department store Santas.\n\nIn a varied show business career, Mr. Williams headlined at major venues such as the Copacabana in New York and Caesars Palace casino in Las Vegas, sang at three Academy Awards ceremonies in the 1960s, hosted the first live telecast of the Grammy Awards in 1971, and headlined the halftime show of Super Bowl VII in 1973. After the assassination of his friend Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, Mr. Williams sang “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” at the funeral.\n\nThere were early attempts to make Mr. Williams a rock star in the Elvis Presley mold; one rock-tinged song, “Butterfly,” rose to No. 1 on the pop charts in 1957. He also ventured promisingly into jazz with his 1961 album “Under Paris Skies,” with Quincy Jones conducting the orchestra.\n\nBut Mr. Williams found his greatest commercial success in the 1960s and early 1970s with anodyne pop and yuletide music, which yielded more than a dozen hits. During this period, he recorded or popularized a slew of lush, orchestra-backed movie themes. Besides his signature number “Moon River” (from “Breakfast at Tiffany’s”), Mr. Williams recorded “Days of Wine and Roses,” “Born Free,” “The Shadow of Your Smile” (from “The Sandpiper”), “Charade,” the theme from “Love Story,” and a love ballad from “The Godfather” known as “Speak Softly Love.”\n\nAs a television show host, Mr. Williams followed in the easygoing tradition of “The Perry Como Show.” The program, whose producers included future “All in the Family” creator Norman Lear, was a highly visible platform for newer talent. Guests included the Osmond Brothers, the Jackson 5 and Simon and Garfunkel. Mr. Williams’s potpourri of entertainers also featured singer-actress Julie Andrews and comedians Woody Allen and Phyllis Diller.\n\nAs a nod to the zanier doings on the popular sketch show “Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In,” Mr. Williams began to feature oddball recurring characters.\n\n“There was the Cookie Bear, a poor guy in a bear suit who couldn’t get any sound from a mike inside the muzzle, so the voice was done by the producer,” he told the London Independent in 2001. “We also had a midget in a German helmet who’d hit me in the knee with a wooden hammer. And the Walking Suitcase, with a guy bent up inside it.”\n\nRobert Thompson, a pop culture historian at Syracuse University, said the show “represented the pleasant last gasp of what we used to think of as mass culture” before the rise of more socially topical and subversive humor on “All in the Family” and “M*A*S*H.”\n\nMr. Williams remained a major recording star for several years and continued to sing concerts well into the 2000s at the Moon River Theatre, a complex he built in the Ozarks town of Branson.\n\nHe received an unexpected burst of attention when his groovy, finger-snapping recordings of “Music to Watch Girls By” and “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You” from 1967 were revived in the late 1990s for TV advertising campaigns for Fiat and Peugeot, respectively.\n\nThe ads briefly transformed Mr. Williams into the hippest grandfather of the moment. He was booked on concert tours of Europe and Asia, where women threw panties at him onstage for the first time in his career.\n\n“I had never had that kind of reaction before, though that might have been partly due to the material I sang,” he wrote in his 2009 memoir, “Moon River and Me.” “Andy Williams crooning ‘Danny Boy’ didn’t have quite the raunch factor of Tom Jones belting out ‘Sex Bomb.’ ”\n\nHoward Andrew Williams was born Dec. 3, 1927, in Wall Lake, Iowa. His father, Jay Williams, was a railway mail clerk who trained the Williams children to sing in the choir of the local Presbyterian church. Their skill at harmonizing led their father to think they were destined for greatness.\n\nBy the late 1930s, the Williams Brothers — Andy and his older siblings Richard, Robert and Donald — began singing on the radio in Des Moines. The family eventually settled in Los Angeles, so the boys could break into film. The Williams Brothers accompanied Bing Crosby on the 1944 pop hit “Swinging on a Star,” an Oscar-winning song Crosby also sang in the film “Going My Way.”\n\nAlthough he did not appear in that movie, Mr. Williams was the subject of enduring curiosity for one of his earliest forays into screen work. At 16, he was asked to dub Lauren Bacall’s voice in the song “How Little We Know” for her film debut in “To Have and Have Not” (1944). Bacall and director Howard Hawks denied that the final cut included Mr. Williams’s voice. Mr. Williams remained coy.\n\n“I really wish, now, it had never happened, because now when people ask me if that’s my voice on the screen I have to compromise and say ‘maybe,’ ” he told the Tulsa World in 2000.\n\nFrom 1947 to 1953, the Williams Brothers teamed on and off with the comedienne and future “Eloise” author Kay Thompson in her widely lauded nightclub act, which transformed music, pantomime and pratfalls into high art and packed large theaters from Hollywood to Paris.\n\nAfter the brothers went their own ways professionally, Andy Williams’s regular appearances on Steve Allen’s “Tonight” show in the mid-1950s launched his solo recording career. He flourished as a pop star with million-selling singles including “Canadian Sunset” and “The Hawaiian Wedding Song.” “I Like Your Kind of Love,” “Butterfly,”\n\nMr. Williams was discreet about his personal life. In his memoir, he disclosed a long affair in the 1950s with Kay Thompson, who was nearly 20 years his senior.\n\nIn 1961, he married the whispery-voiced Claudine Longet, a French-born Las Vegas showgirl who became a singer and actress. The marriage produced three children — Noelle, Christian and Robert — before ending in divorce.\n\nLonget later became a subject of notoriety for fatally shooting her lover, the ski champion Vladimir “Spider” Sabich, at their Aspen, Colo., home in 1976. She claimed that the gun fired accidentally. Mr. Williams testified on his ex-wife’s behalf and, in 1977, a judge sentenced her to 30 days in jail for criminally negligent homicide, a misdemeanor.\n\nIn 1991, Mr. Williams married Debbie Haas and lived with her in Branson. Besides his wife, survivors include his three children from his first marriage.\n\nMr. Williams could be an easy target for satirists. The brightly colored cardigans and turtlenecks that he trotted out for Christmas shows have, in recent years, been lampooned by Comedy Central’s faux-conservative talk-show host Stephen Colbert.\n\nBut if Mr. Williams was perceived as unhip, he was deliberately so. He decided long ago that to sustain a long career, it was wise to avoid the vagaries of the avant garde and ever-shifting youth fads.\n\n“I wouldn’t want to sing solely for teenagers,” he said in 1958. “Once they go to college, their musical taste changes, and then where would I be?”", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:54:09.356-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:54:09.356-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/9568283/Andy-Williams-dies-aged-84.html", "title" : "Andy Williams dies aged 84", "text" : "Williams was the velvet-voiced crooner who became a standard bearer for easy-listening music with hit songs including Moon River and Music to Watch Girls By .\n\nIn 2009, at the age of 81, he published his autobiography. Moon River and Me, which chronicled a life lived to the full, from the early days in Iowa singing with his brothers, through the heady years in Vegas to his final years in Branson, Missouri.\n\n\"Sure I waited a long time to do it, but who wants to buy an autobiography of someone in their teens?\" Williams said at the time. \"You've got to live life to write a book about it.\"\n\nWilliams, who was born on December 3, 1927 in Wall Lake, Iowa, made his professional singing debut at age 8 with his three brothers as part of the Williams Brothers Quartet. He became one of the most popular vocalists of the 1960s and died at home in Branson, where he owns the Moon River Theatre. Moon River - written by Johnny Mercer and Henry Mancini - was one of Williams' signature songs.\n\nWilliams, an avid golfer, was also well-known in the 1970s and '80s for his Christmas television specials. Known for his affable, easy-going personality, he hosted the Grammys, the Golden Globes and the People's Choice Awards numerous times. He sang the American national anthem at Super Bowl VII in 1973.\n\nWilliams' unflappable manner on television and in concert was mirrored offstage. \"I guess I've never really been aggressive, although almost everybody else in show business fights and gouges and knees to get where they want to be,\" he once said. \"My trouble is, I'm not constructed temperamentally along those lines.\"\n\nAmong his other chart hits were \"Can't Get Used to Losing You\", \"Happy Heart\", and \"Where Do I Begin\", the theme song from the 1970 blockbuster film, Love Story. He hit the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart with \"Almost There\" (1965), \"Can't Help Falling In Love\" (1970), \"Home Lovin' Man\" (1970) and \"Solitaire\" (1973).\n\n\"The old cliche says that if you can remember the 1960s, you weren't there,\" the singer once recalled. \"Well, I was there all right, but my memory of them is blurred - not by any drugs I took but by the relentless pace of the schedule I set myself.\"\n\nHe is survived by his wife Debbie and his three children, Robert, Noelle and Christian. Williams had the children with French-born dancer Claudine Longet. They divorced in 1975 and the following year she was charged with fatally shooting her boyfriend, alpine ski racer Spider Sabich in Aspen. Williams made headlines as he stood by her side throughout the public trial. He married Debbie Meyer in 1991.\n\nAlthough \"Moon River\" was covered by countless artists, Williams made the song his personal brand. In fact, he insisted on it.\n\n\"When I hear anybody else sing it, it's all I can to do stop myself from shouting at the television screen, 'No!

Luis Gutierrez, the Illinois Democrat who is chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Task Force on Immigration, took everyone -- President Obama, GOP challenger Mitt Romney and debate moderator Jim Lehrer -- to task for the omission.\n\n“It is absurd that a 90 minute debate on domestic policy and the economy would not address immigration at all, not even in passing,” Gutierrez said in a written statement, “especially when Latino voters are considered the key demographic that will determine who sits in the White House.”\n\n“The moderator dropped the ball, the President missed an opportunity, and Romney dodged a bullet,” he said.\n\nThe debate was designed to focus on domestic policy. The second debate, scheduled for Oct. 16, is expected to focus on both domestic and foreign policy. The third debate, on Oct. 22, is to cover foreign policy.\n\nFrank Sharry, head of America’s Voice, a Washington D.C.-based group that favors more lenient immigration policies, expressed confidence that the issue will come up at one of the remaining debates.\n\n“I was disappointed but the, shall we say, loose structure of the debate kept the focus on the economy,” Sharry said. “I'm confident the issue will come up in future debates.”\n\nOn Twitter, Latinos debated about whether its omission was significant.\n\nSome said that it is, but others said that jobs were more pressing for Latinos – who have a higher unemployment rate than other groups -- and all Americans.\n\nIt was a point echoed by the Mitt Romney campaign.\n\nThe Dallas Morning News quoted Ben Ginsberg, chief counsel to the Romney campaign, as saying: “Hispanic voters are no different than other voters in that what they will look for is who can provide more jobs for middle-class Americans, and for communities. It’s all about jobs and the economy.”\n\nSome placed the blame on the moderator, PBS NewsHour host Lehrer, for not raising the topic for the candidates to address.\n\n“It’s Jim Lehrer’s fault,” said Miguel Perez, a nationally syndicated columnist who writes about Latino issues and who chairs the Communications Department at Lehman College in New York. “Lehrer didn’t go anywhere near Latino issues – voting rights, immigration. It was a debate mostly focused on the economy, but he could have at least mentioned immigration at some point. He really didn’t give the candidates much room to talk about it.”\n\n“There was, at most, a little opening when Obama had an opportunity to bring it up,” Perez added. “When he explained all the hard-line positions that Romney has taken on several things, he could have added immigration to that list. But that’s about the only opening I saw, and it wasn’t really that much of an opening.”\n\nAt a press conference in Colorado on Thursday, Obama raised immigration fleetingly when he referred to Romney’s opposition to the DREAM Act, a measure that would give undocumented immigrants who were brought as minors a pathway to legalization if they meet a strict set of criteria.\n\nDrawing contrasts between himself and his GOP challenger on various issues, Obama, who cast Romney as uncaring about those who are struggling, said to the crowd of supporters “You’re the reason a young immigrant who grew up here and went to school here, and pledged allegiance to our flag will no longer be deported from the only country she’s ever called home.”\n\nDan Stein, the head of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, or FAIR, a Washington D.C.-group that favors strict immigration enforcement, said: “Romney could certainly help himself by pledging to enforce the immigration laws as they are written and proposing cuts in overall immigration to reduce unemployment.”\n\n“But polls show that Romney’s main challenge right now is to prevent Obama from using the promise of immigration amnesties to energize his political machine on voting day,” Stein said. “Obama’s general deferred amnesty program is also very unpopular with Romney’s base. Since Romney wants to avoid firing up Obama’s base, and Obama wants to avoid further riling up Romney’s base. Voila -- no immigration discussion. Maybe next time.”\n\nElizabeth Llorente can be reached at elizabeth.llorente@foxnewslatino.com\n\nLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:54:37.816-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:54:37.816-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20121004/us-debate-big-bird/", "title" : "Debate thrusts Big Bird into presidential campaign", "text" : "NEW YORK — Big Bird has never been so hot.\n\n\"Saturday Night Live,\" Jimmy Fallon, Piers Morgan, the \"Today\" show and \"Good Morning America\" all asked for appearances from the \"Sesame Street\" character on Thursday after he was unexpectedly thrust into the presidential campaign by Mitt Romney.\n\nSesame Workshop says the giant yellow Muppet is declining all appearances, but there was this tweet from Big Bird on the Sesame Street account: \"My bed time is usually 7:45, but I was really tired yesterday and fell asleep at 7! Did I miss anything last night?\"\n\nYes, Bird. During Wednesday's debate with President Barack Obama, Romney called for cutting federal funding to PBS, despite saying, \"I love Big Bird.\" It renewed a long-running debate over subsidies to public broadcasting.\n\n\"I'm going to stop the subsidy to PBS,\" the former Massachusetts governor, a Republican, said during a deficit-cutting discussion. \"I'm going to stop other things. I like PBS. I love Big Bird. I actually like you, too, Jim (Lehrer, PBS newsman and debate moderator). But I'm not going to ... keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for it.\"\n\nObama brought up his opponent's plans for Big Bird during a campaign stop Thursday in Madison, Wis.\n\n\"I just want to make sure I've got this straight: He'll get rid of regulations on Wall Street, but he's going to crack down on `Sesame Street,'\" Obama said of Romney. \"Thank goodness somebody's finally cracking down on Big Bird! Who knew that he was responsible for all these deficits! Elmo's got to watch out!\"\n\nPBS chief Paula Kerger said she \"just about fell off the sofa\" when the issue suddenly came up during the debate. She said that if the subsidy goes, so will some PBS stations.\n\nFederal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting totals $450 million this year, accounting for about 15 percent of the CPB's budget, she said. Federal money supplements the budgets of PBS' 179 stations nationally. For some of the smaller stations in rural areas, this subsidy accounts for more than half of their yearly budget, so many can't operate without it.\n\nConsidering Romney stressed the importance of education, she said she hopes he realizes the extent of educational programming that PBS offers. Four out of five children under age 5 watch public television, where \"Sesame Street\" is a long-running hit, she said.\n\n\"To me, public television is like mom and apple pie,\" she said. \"Maybe it's because I'm just too close to it. Maybe it's because I talk to so many people for whom public television is a lifeline.\"\n\nBut public broadcasting funding has been a frequent target of congressional Republicans, who believe PBS and National Public Radio favor liberal points of view.\n\n\"It is demoralizing to have our work put in the middle of this debate,\" Kerger said. \"We don't belong here.\"\n\nThe issue quickly became a hot topic on social media, where Twitter reported a peak of 17,000 tweets per second about Big Bird. The hashtag (hash)SaveBigBird quickly sprouted up.\n\nNew York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof tweeted: \"Hey, I figured out how Romney will balance the budget: sale of TV rights to broadcast the decapitation of Big Bird.\"\n\nFor several years, \"Sesame Street\" has produced videos and other materials for the Pentagon to help children deal with parents' absences during tours of duty as well as other stresses suffered by the children of troops. Asked at a Pentagon briefing whether the Defense Department wants to see its relationship with the program continue, press secretary George Little sidestepped the question.\n\n\"I will say that we've had a long-lasting and effective partnership with `Sesame Street' and they have supported military children,\" Little said. \"But I'm not going to get into politics here – I wouldn't want to ruffle any feathers, so to speak.\"\n\nSesame Workshop, the producers who make \"Sesame Street,\" noted that while it is not part of PBS, it depends on the stations to distribute its work.\n\n\"Sesame Workshop is a nonpartisan, nonprofit educational organization,\" said Sherrie Westin, Sesame Workshop spokeswoman. \"We do not comment on campaigns, but we're happy we can all agree that everyone likes Big Bird.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Pauline Jelinek in Washington contributed to this report.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:54:39.498-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:54:39.498-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57525698/poll-uncommitted-voters-say-romney-wins-debate/?pageNum=1&tag=page", "title" : "Poll: Uncommitted voters say Romney wins debate", "text" : "Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney speaks during the first presidential debate with President Barack Obama at the University of Denver, Wednesday, Oct. 3, 2012, in Denver. AP\n\nThis article was written by Sarah Dutton, Jennifer De Pinto, Anthony Salvanto, Fred Backus and Lindsey Boerma\n\nBy a 2 to 1 margin, uncommitted voters crowned Mitt Romney the winner over President Obama in the first presidential debate in Debate, Colo., on Wednesday night, according to a 500-person instant poll taken by CBS News.\n\nIn the moments following the candidates' performances on the University of Denver stage, 46 percent of voters gave the economy-centric debate to Romney, 22 percent said they believed the president was the winner, and 32 percent called it a tie. More good news for the GOP nominee: 56 percent of those polled said they viewed Romney in a better light after watching the debate. Eleven percent said their opinion of him dropped, and 32 percent cited no change in opinion.\n\nPerhaps most promising for Romney, whose upper-class income has helped stifle his ability to relate to the \"average American,\" the percentage of those polled who said they felt the former Massachusetts governor cares about their needs and problems spiked from 30 percent pre-debate to 63 percent post-debate. President Obama also enjoyed a bump in that category, with 53 percent of voters saying they believed he cares about their issues before the debate, moving to 69 percent after the debate.\n\nThe uncommitted voters polled are less likely than voters overall to identify with either of the two majority political parties. Six in 10 call themselves independents, 22 percent identify as Democrats, and 18 percent say they're Republicans.\n\nUncommitted debate watchers saw Mitt Romney as the winner on handling the economy (60 to 39 percent) and the deficit (68 to 31 percent), just as they did before the debate. These voters also think Romney will do a better job on taxes (52 to 47 percent), a reversal from before the debate, when uncommitted voters gave the president a 52 to 40 percent advantage on that. The president still leads on Medicare, 53 to 45 percent. \n\n\n\nUncommitted voters include both undecided voters and those who say they have a candidate preference, but could still change their minds. Before the debate, 23 percent favored President Obama and 22 percent favored Romney, while 50 percent were still undecided. But while voter preference for Mr. Obama changed little, after the debate support for Romney increased 12 points. \n\n\n\nFor full poll results, see next page\n\n\n\nThis CBS News poll was conducted online using GfK's web-enabled KnowledgePanel(r), a probability-based panel designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

And New York City was planning to build temporary polling sites in tents in some of its worst-hit neighborhoods.\n\nThe aftermath of Hurricane Sandy is threatening to create Election Day chaos in some storm-racked sections of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut — and some effects may also be felt in other states, including Pennsylvania, where some polling sites still lacked power on Friday morning.\n\nDisrupted postal delivery will probably slow the return of absentee ballots. And with some polling sites likely to be moved, elections officials were bracing for a big influx of provisional paper ballots — which could delay the vote count in places.\n\nWeary local elections officials vowed that the vote would go on. “Come hell or high water — we had both — we’re voting on Tuesday,” William T. Biamonte, the Democratic commissioner at the Nassau County Board of Elections, said in an interview.\n\nStorm-related voting disruptions seem unlikely to change the outcome of the presidential election, since the biggest problem areas are in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, which are all expected to go for President Obama. But even when elections officials get the polling sites up and running, many voters may stay away as they grapple with lingering damage to their homes, power failures and gas shortages. With turnout projected to be down in all these states, Mr. Obama could see his share of the national popular vote reduced.\n\nThe storm may have already affected the early vote, which could be important, given that analysts estimate that more than a third of the votes this year will be cast before Election Day. Early voting was temporarily halted in some states. In Ohio, the crucial Democratic stronghold of Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, had more people vote early every day this year than in 2008 — until Monday, the day of the storm, when the daily tally began to lag from its levels of four years ago.\n\nBut the lingering aftermath of the storm could have a bigger — if not always easy to predict — effect on state and local races. In the Senate race in Connecticut, where Christopher S. Murphy, a Democratic congressman, is running against Linda E. McMahon, a Republican former professional wrestling executive, some Democrats worry that storm damage in Democratic strongholds like Bridgeport could depress the vote.\n\nSeveral close House races are being waged in areas that saw significant storm damage. In Suffolk County, on the eastern end of Long Island, Representative Tim Bishop, a five-term Democrat, is facing a rematch with Randy Altschuler, a Republican businessman who nearly won the seat two years ago. And on Staten Island, which saw some of the worst storm damage in New York City, Representative Michael G. Grimm, a first-term Republican facing questions about his fund-raising practices, is trying to stave off a challenge from Mark Murphy, a Democrat.\n\nThen there are all the other local races, from school board elections across New Jersey to the hard fought-race for control of the New York State Senate.\n\nWith thousands of lawyers from both campaigns fanning out across the country, storm-related issues could provide new fodder for court challenges. As Wendy Weiser, the director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, a public interest organization, put it, “There will be an incentive for whichever candidate is losing in the affected states to look for litigating opportunities as a result of the disrupted election.”\n\nState and county elections officials are working around the clock to make sure the voting goes as smoothly as possible next week, said Dennis Scott Kobitz, the president of the New Jersey Association of Election Officials. “I actually slept here last night,” Mr. Kobitz, the administrator of the board of elections in Union County, N.J., said in a phone interview from his office.\n\nHe said that around half of the county’s polling sites still lacked power on Friday afternoon, and that he was making preparations to get generators for all of them by Tuesday.\n\nBut the problems throughout the region were considerable. Some polling sites were flooded or damaged, or cut off by roads needing repair. Others were in schools that had been transformed to shelters for people displaced by the storm.\n\nAnd some election boards were struggling to find power or get assurances from the utilities that power would be restored in time. With their servers down, they also found themselves unable to update their Web sites for the public.\n\nA telephone hot line set up by the New York City Board of Elections to help people find their voting sites was out of service. “Our central phone bank (866 VOTE NYC) is not functioning properly and our Manhattan and Staten Island offices have been closed since Monday due to loss of power,” the board’s Web site said on Friday.\n\nNew York State extended the deadline for absentee ballots to be received and counted to 13 days after Election Day, from seven days, to allow for postal delays caused by the storm. But they must be postmarked no later than Monday, said John Conklin, a spokesman for the state’s Board of Elections, which has been trying to help local boards get power restored or, failing that, get generators, fuel and extension cords.\n\nA little-noticed New York State law allows counties to seek permission for a second day of voting if they determine that voter turnout was less than 25 percent “as the direct consequence” of a disaster, but several election lawyers said that they did not believe it had ever been invoked and that it was unlikely to be used next week.\n\nSuffolk County plans to relocate five of its 342 polling places, said Jesse Garcia, a board of elections employee, who said that cards would be sent to voters and that workers would be sent to the closed sites to direct voters to the new ones.\n\nIn Bridgeport, Mayor Bill Finch took Connecticut’s secretary of the state, Denise Merrill, through his storm-ravaged city on Friday, stopping at the Longfellow School, the only one of the city’s 24 polling places still closed, which he said had been under two feet of water. Residents who normally vote there will be redirected to a nearby school to vote. Ms. Merrill promised to help municipalities without power to find generators.\n\nMs. Weiser, the lawyer at the Brennan Center, noted that the center had worked all year to try to block or mitigate strict election laws passed in a number of Republican-led states that it believed would put up hurdles for voters, often with success. “The storm created new, non-manmade hurdles,” she lamented.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:54:56.456-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:54:56.456-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/11/01/nyc-mayor-bloomberg-backs-obama-for-re-election-citing-climate-change/", "title" : "NYC Mayor Bloomberg backs Obama for re-election, citing climate change", "text" : "New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is endorsing President Obama for re-election, citing agenda items that Obama has touted but failed to make legislative progress on: climate change.\n\nBloomberg's announcement comes as New York City and much of the East Coast work to rebound after the devastating blow dealt by Hurricane Sandy, a storm that Bloomberg said may be an example of the havoc wreaked by man-made climate change.\n\n\"The devastation that Hurricane Sandy brought to New York City and much of the Northeast -- in lost lives, lost homes and lost business -- brought the stakes of Tuesday’s presidential election into sharp relief,\" Bloomberg said Thursday in an opinion article he wrote for Bloomberg.com.\n\n\"Our climate is changing. And while the increase in extreme weather we have experienced in New York City and around the world may or may not be the result of it, the risk that it might be -- given this week’s devastation -- should compel all elected leaders to take immediate action.\"\n\nObama set climate change legislation as one of his goals on the campaign trail in 2008, but the legislative measures he proposed, the so-called cap-and trade plan, never made it through Congress.\n\nBloomberg, while commending Mitt Romney for his work on the issue as Massachusetts governor, said he was concerned that Romney has since \"reversed course\" on that and other issues.\n\n\"If the 1994 or 2003 version of Mitt Romney were running for president, I may well have voted for him because, like so many other independents, I have found the past four years to be, in a word, disappointing,\" Bloomberg wrote.\n\nObama issued a statement welcoming the endorsement and pledging to continue to stand with New York in its time of need.\n\n\"While we may not agree on every issue, Mayor Bloomberg and I agree on the most important issues of our time -- that the key to a strong economy is investing in the skills and education of our people, that immigration reform is essential to an open and dynamic democracy, and that climate change is a threat to our children's future, and we owe it to them to do something about it,\" Obama said.\n\nThe mayor, however, didn't shy from criticizing Obama.\n\n\"As president, he devoted little time and effort to developing and sustaining a coalition of centrists, which doomed hope for any real progress on illegal guns, immigration, tax reform, job creation and deficit reduction,\" Bloomberg said. \"And rather than uniting the country around a message of shared sacrifice, he engaged in partisan attacks and has embraced a divisive populist agenda focused more on redistributing income than creating it.\"\n\nEven so, the mayor praised Obama for \"some important victories on issues that will help define our future.\"\n\nHe cited Obama's record on education, gay marriage and climate change, saying Obama \"has taken major steps to reduce our carbon consumption, including setting higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks.\"\n\nBoth Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney had eagerly sought the nod from Bloomberg, an independent and former Republican who didn't endorse a presidential candidate in 2008.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:54:58.806-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:54:58.806-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.economist.com/blogs/lexington/2012/10/storms-and-elections", "title" : "Storms and elections: The politics of Hurricane Sandy", "text" : "IS HURRICANE SANDY capable of altering the election result? The presidential candidates are hunkering down and trying to avoid looking partisan as this big, wet storm heads for the eastern seaboard. But any number of calculations are being made by the campaigns. Plausible arguments are flying, explaining why this storm is bad news, or is it good news, for both sides.\n\nIn a conference call with reporters on Monday morning, bosses at the campaign headquarters of Barack Obama in Chicago stressed that the president is focused \"on the storm and governing the country\", and noted that he had cancelled events in storm-hit states from Florida to Wisconsin. A well-handled disaster can strengthen an incumbent president (just as a Katrina-level bungle is a political, as well as human disaster).\n\nMitt Romney cancelled events planned for Monday night and Tuesday, citing the need to avoid putting supporters in danger or tying up emergency services. In Virginia, the Romney campaign bus will be delivering storm-relief supplies. The Romney campaign also sent out a notice that it had suspended fundraising emails to the District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Virginia.\n\nTo be brutal, a certain amount of bad weather on election day helps conservatives in every democracy. In crude terms, car-driving conservative retirees still turn out in driving rain, when bus-taking lower-income workers just back from a night shift are more likely to give rain-soaked polls a miss. School closures are a particular problem for low-income families or single mothers scrambling to find childcare. In this case, the weather is supposed to clear up well ahead of election day, but the impact could be felt in the turnout of early voters.\n\nDemocrats will perceive that as bad news. The Obama campaign has pinned big hopes on increasing turnout among Obama-supporting \"sporadic voters\", the sort of voters who give mid-term elections a miss but may turn out in presidential years. According to Michael McDonald, an elections expert at George Mason University whom I spoke to last week, this is the precise moment in the election cycle when sporadic voters are most likely to turn out.\n\nThe very first early voters are those who cannot wait to vote: they are the partisans who could be seen queuing outside polling stations in Ohio or Florida on the first mornings of early voting, like bargain-hunters hitting the sales. Now, several days into early voting and a week from election day, would normally be the moment when less zealous supporters were supposed to be finding a moment to cast a ballot.\n\nThere are others who believe that Sandy will benefit the president, with the storm freezing the election campaign, and Mr Romney's perceived momentum, in place. In short, nobody knows how it will impact the race.\n\nFor proof of the uncertainty that reigns just now, I can only cite my favourite campaign email of the last 24 hours, a four-paragraph missive from Mr Romney in which one full paragraph is devoted to asking supporters to bring campaign yard signs indoors before the storm strikes. \"In high winds they can be dangerous, and cause damage to homes and property,\" Mr Romney urges.\n\nSensible advice, no doubt, but something in me likes the idea of a multi-billion dollar election juggernaut being halted by visions of a voter impaled then pinned to a wind-lashed lawn by a flying Romney-for-president yard sign.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:55:01.565-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:55:01.565-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505263_162-57539893/colin-powell-endorses-barack-obama-for-president/", "title" : "Colin Powell endorses Barack Obama for president", "text" : "(CBS News) Former Secretary of State Colin Powell broke with the Republican party during the 2008 election, to endorse then-candidate Barack Obama for president, calling Obama a \"transformational figure.\"\n\nWith 12 days to go before the presidential election, Powell publicly endorsed President Obama for re-election on \"CBS This Morning\" Thursday\n\n\"I voted for him in 2008 and I plan to stick with him in 2012 and I'll be voting for he and for Vice President Joe Biden next month.\"\n\nPowell explained his choice to Charlie Rose and Norah O'Donnell:\n\nSummarizing the past four years under Obama, Powell said \"Generally we've come out of the dive and we're starting to gain altitude.\" He acknowledged that problems remain, saying \"The unemployment rate is too high, people are still hurting in housing but I see that we're starting to rise up.\"\n\nTurning to foreign policy, Powell said he saw \"the president get us of one war, start to get us out of a second war and did not get us into any new wars. And finally I think that the actions he has taken with respect to protecting us from terrorism have been very very solid. And so, I think we ought to keep on the track that we are on.\"\n\nPowell expressed his concern about Republican candidate Mitt Romney's changing positions on international affairs. \"The governor who was saying things at the debate on Monday night ... was saying things that were quite different from what he said earlier. I'm not quite sure which Gov. Romney we would be getting with respect to foreign policy.\"\n\n\"One day he has a certain strong view about staying in Afghanistan but then on Monday night he agrees with the withdrawal, same thing in Iraq. On almost every issue that was discussed on Monday night, Governor Romney agreed with the President with some nuances. But this is quite a different set of foreign policy views than he had earlier in the campaign. And my concern ... is that sometimes I don't sense that he has thought through these issues as thoroughly as he should have.\"\n\nPowell also said that he has given close consideration to Romney's domestic policies. \"As I listen to what his proposals are especially with respect to dealing with respect to our most significant issue, the economy, it's essentially let's cut taxes and compensate for that with other things but that compensation does not cover all of the cuts intended or the new expenses associated with defense.\"\n\nPowell said that he did not give either candidate early notice of his endorsement, but that he has \"the utmost respect for\" and spoke to Gov. Romney several weeks ago, and speaks to President Obama regularly.\n\nHe added that with this endorsement, he \"signed on for a long patrol with President Obama\" and that he feels more comfortable with Obama's stances on climate change, immigration, and education.\n\nPowell also criticized congressional leaders for not living up to their responsibilities, mainly around resolving the approaching fiscal cliff.\n\n\"The major problem faced either by Gov. Romney or President Obama, whoever wins the election, is going to be what to do about the fiscal cliff we're about to fly over,\" Powell said.\n\n\"This is something that was put in place by Congress and while we're talking about the two candidates for president let's not forget that Congress bears a lot of responsibility for many of the problems that we have now. They're the ones that write the appropriations bills. They're the ones that pass the legislation for more spending and for the various entitlement programs that people have trouble with.\"\n\nGen. Powell last joined \"CBS This Morning\" in June, and at the time remained noncommittal about his support for either candidate in the race for the White House. \"Whatever judgement I have right now would be incomplete. I haven't seen everything that Mitt Romney is going to do. I haven't seen how our economy is going to play out,\" he said in June.\n\nAnd, despite his endorsement of a Democratic candidate in two presidential elections, Powell says he remains a Republican. \"I think I'm a Republican of a more moderate mold,\" he said before adding, \"That's something of a dying breed I'm sorry to say.\"", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:55:06.918-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:55:06.918-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/10/minor-party-don-quixotes-beat-up-on-republicans-democrats-in-debate/", "title" : "Minor-Party ‘Don Quixotes’ Beat Up on Republicans, Democrats in Debate", "text" : "“Did we have opening statements,” former CNN and current Ora.tv host Larry King asked after candidates at Tuesday’s minor-party debate in Chicago had each answered the first question.\n\n“Unfortunately, no,” debate co-host Christina Tobin of the Free and Equal Elections Foundation answered. “Grassroots!”\n\n“OK, this will be the opening statement, and then we’ll go to the second question,” King said, and that was that.\n\nSo it went onstage at the Hilton Chicago, where Tobin’s group hosted a debate between four minor-party presidential candidates who have made the ballot in enough states to win the presidency: Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Libertarian Party candidate and former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, Constitution Party candidate and former Virginia congressman of both the Republican and Democratic parties Virgil Goode, and Justice Party candidate Rocky Anderson.\n\nFree and Equal will host a “runoff” debate in Washington, D.C., Tuesday between the two candidates who receive the most votes on the group’s website, FreeandEqual.org.\n\nThe candidates beat up not only on the two major parties, but on mainstream policies. Free college education, term limits, marijuana legalization and an end to political action committees were among the ideas proposed at Tuesday night’s debate, which was broadcast by C-SPAN, Russia TV, and Al Jazeera English.\n\n“We’ve all suffered through the sellout of our government to Wall Street,” Anderson, 61 and a former Salt Lake City, Utah, mayor, said. “Young people are burdened with crushing, record tuition debt. Millions of families have lost their homes … while Wall Street fat cats who are buying our elections have made out like bandits.”\n\n“When it comes to political campaign contributions, the candidates should be required to wear NASCAR-like jackets with patches on the jackets commensurate” to contributions, Johnson said. “Regardless of whether or not Romney gets elected or Obama gets elected … we’re going to find ourselves with a continued, heightened police state in this country; we’re going to find ourselves continuing to militarily intervene in the world, which has resulted in hundreds of millions of enemies to this country that wouldn’t otherwise exist.”\n\nOpposition to political money was on full display across the stage.\n\n“I want to pass an amendment that clarifies that money is not speech and corporations are not people,” said the Green Parry’s Stein, 62, a Massachusetts physician.\n\nFormer Virginia congressman Goode, 66, said, “I’m for no political action committees; individual contributions only. No super PACs. And I believe Congress can craft legislation with presidential leadership to stop political action committees.”\n\nGoode was the only candidate onstage not to support marijuana legalization, a major plank in Johnson’s Libertarian platform, and the major plank when he began touring college campuses in advance of his run for president in early 2011.\n\n“Let’s end the drug wars. Legalize marijuana now,” the former Republican 59, said. “Let’s repeal the PATRIOT Act. I would have never signed the National Defense Authorization Act, allowing you and I, as U.S. citizens, to be arrested and detained without being charged. That’s the reason we fought wars in this country.”\n\nThe full political spectrum was on display, from Stein’s support for free, government-funded college education and a “Green New Deal,” to Anderson’s proposal of a WPA-like program and protections from sexual-orientation discrimination, to Goode’s insistence that the government can’t afford more Pell education grants, to Johnson’s call for a 43-percent cut in military spending and opposition to government’s involvement in marriage and drug policy.\n\nThe common thread was opposition to corporations, political spending and staid power structures.\n\n“Imagine if there had been a candidate included in the Obama-Romney debates to challenge our plutocracy, our government that is run by and for the benefit of monstrous corporations rather than in the interest of the people of this country,” Anderson said in his closing remarks.\n\n“You’re kind of Don Quixotes in a way,” King said, “but the windmills have a way of stopping, and we have a way of saluting you just for getting into the fray.”", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:55:09.400-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:55:09.400-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/23/presidential-debate-2012_n_2004043.html", "title" : "Obama, Romney Agree On Foreign Policy (VIDEO)", "text" : "BOCA RATON, Fla. -- There may be a presidential election around the corner, but voters won't have two competing foreign policies to choose from at the ballot box, at least among the major parties. If Monday night's debate proved anything, it showed that when it comes to drone strikes, the war in Afghanistan, relations with Pakistan, the intervention in Libya, support for Israel or for \"crippling sanctions\" on Iran, there is little difference between the two parties.\n\n\"I know that Mitt Romney tried to offer his endorsement of virtually everything President Obama did,\" said Obama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki. \"We accept his endorsement.\"\n\nOr, as the former Fox personality Glenn Beck put it on his Twitter page, \"I am glad to know that Mitt agrees with Obama so much. No, really. Why vote?\"\n\nOnly the debate's 90-minute clock limited the ability of the two men to agree on the fundamental role of the United States in world affairs. An hour into the debate, Afghanistan, where tens of thousands of U.S. troops still remain, had barely been mentioned.\n\nThat left the debate one of style rather than substance, an area where President Barack Obama dominated, turning in a commanding while at times edgy performance that kept Romney on his heels. Foreign policy is not Romney's strength -- witness his gaffe-riddled tour of friendly nations this summer. But the job of the challenger, when agreement is so pervasive, is simply to come across as competent. \"People just have to feel comfortable he's presidential and in command of the facts,\" said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), a Romney surrogate, after the debate.\n\nRomney policy adviser Lanhee Chen said the Republican's main goal was to remain above the fray and stay calm and positive, rather than engaging in a nasty dogfight. That, he believed, was all that was required to keep the momentum that Romney gained from the first debate on Oct. 3 and which appears to have slowed but not stopped since, driving Romney ahead in national numbers and to a dead heat in key swing states like Ohio.\n\nObama didn't let the broad consensus stop him from attacking Romney at every turn. \"Governor Romney,\" Obama said in his first response, \"I’m glad that you agree that we have been successful in going after Al Qaida, but I have to tell you that, you know, your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map and is not designed to keep Americans safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in the Middle East.\"\n\nRomney's goal, meanwhile, was to paint a picture of chaos and failure in the Middle East. \"We’ve watched this tumult in the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see Al Qaida rushing in, you see other jihadist groups rushing in,\" Romney said. \"They’re throughout many nations in the Middle East.\"\n\nRomney's least presidential moment came when he criticized Obama for overseeing a Navy that is too small, which Romney dramatized by noting that we have fewer ships today and \"our Navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917.\"\n\nObama responded sarcastically. \"I think Governor Romney maybe hasn’t spent enough time looking at how our military works. You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916. Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military’s changed,\" he said, growing even more snarky. \"We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines. And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we’re counting ships. It’s what are our capabilities.\"\n\nRomney surrogates spent much of the post-debate spin session characterizing Obama's performance as insulting and petty.\n\n\"Romney refused to get trapped in petty back and forth,\" said Chaffetz, echoing a repeated talking point from the GOP. \"The president was almost looking to land personal blows.\"\n\nBy contrast, Romney seemed intent on not pressing hot political buttons, most notably on the matter of the attacks in Libya, indicating that that political viability of that topic may have run its course.\n\nDan Senor, a foreign policy advisor to the Romney campaign, said this had been a deliberate decision.\n\n\"What he chose to do up there was to take Libya out of the back and forth and raise the issue of what it says in the macro sense,\" Senor said. \"It is a sign that President Obama's foreign policy is unraveling in a number of ways.\"\n\nInstead it was Obama who found himself repeatedly raising Libya, in order to emphasize what he portrayed as his deft handling of a complex situation. Psaki, the Obama spokeswoman, said that the Obama campaign felt the discussion of Libya in the previous debate, at Hofstra, \"was one of our best moments.\"\n\nOne of the most contentious moments of Monday's debate came not over foreign policy, but over Romney's insistence that Detroit followed his prescription to its successful turnaround. It's an audacious move, given that Romney had opposed federal assistance during the bankruptcy process, which observers of the industry say would have quickly led to liquidation of General Motors and Chrysler. Romney insisted he had supported federal help during bankruptcy for the auto industry.\n\n\"I said they need -- these companies need to go through a managed bankruptcy. And in that process, they can get government help and government guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that they’d built up,\" Romney said.\n\n\"You did not say that you would provide government help,\" Obama challenged.\n\n\"I said that we would provide guarantees, and that was what was able to allow these companies to go through bankruptcy, to come out of bankruptcy,\" Romney said, suggesting Obama and the audience read his op-ed in the New York Times closely.\n\n\"The federal government should provide guarantees for post-bankruptcy financing and assure car buyers that their warranties are not at risk,\" Romney wrote in that OpEd. \"In a managed bankruptcy, the federal government would propel newly competitive and viable automakers, rather than seal their fate with a bailout check.\"\n\nRomney, in withholding government help during bankruptcy -- what he called sealing their fate with a \"bailout check\" -- would have made it highly unlikely that the companies would have emerged from bankruptcy in a position to receive the federal guarantees.\n\nRomney's strategy to agree with Obama as much as possible on foreign policy left him unable to attack one of the president's weakest points, the ongoing war in Afghanistan. Obama's post-election surge of troops has done remarkably little to bring the war closer to an end, calling the entire strategy into question. But now that Obama has announced the eventual withdrawal of troops -- a withdrawal Romney has at turns opposed and supported -- Romney had little entry to challenge him.\n\nWhile Romney has previously said it is unwise to lay out a timetable for withdrawal -- a position Paul Ryan repeated at the most recent vice presidential debate -- he embraced one Monday night. \"Well, we’re going to be finished by 2014, and when I’m president, we’ll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014. The commanders and the generals there are on track to do so,\" Romney said, following with effusive praise of Obama's handling of the war. \"We’ve seen progress over the past several years. The surge has been successful and the training program is proceeding apace. There are now a large number of Afghan Security Forces, 350,000 that are ready to step in to provide security and we’re going to be able to make that transition by the end of 2014. So our troops will come home at that point.\"\n\n\"The governor agreed with some things with the president but the agreement on some things only highlights the huge disagreement on others,\" said former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, a Romney surrogate, citing the defense budget as one example. \"How can you be a superpower without superpower capabilities?\"\n\nAsked about one potential point of contention that Romney had opted to avoid, over whether drawing down troops in Afghanistan qualified as a savings, Sununu thought for a moment. \"That's a good point,\" he said. \"But it's not a point that sways voters.

White ties are worn and jokes are told at the benefit, which has brought the top candidates since the 1960s.\n\nCheck out each candidate’s top five jokes and watch their stand-up routines:\n\n1. “I am pleased once again to have the chance to see Governor Cuomo who is already being talked about for higher office a very impressive fellow but he may be getting a little ahead of himself. I mean, Let me get this straight- the man put in one term and a governor, he has a father who happened to be a governor, and he thinks that’s enough to run for President.”\n\n2. “Of course we’re down to the final months of the Presidents term, as presidents—as President Obama surveys the Waldorf banquet room with everyone in white tie and finery you have to wonder what he’s thinking “So little time, so much to redistribute.” And don’t be surprised if the President mentions this evening the monthly jobs report where there was a slight improvement in the numbers. He knows how to seize the moment, this President, and already has a compelling new campaign slogan “You’re better off now than you were four weeks ago.”\n\n3. “People seem to be very curious as to how we prepare for the debates, let me tell you what I do: First, refrain from alcohol for 65 years before the debate. Second, find the biggest available straw man and then just mercilessly attack him- Big Bird didn’t even see it coming. And by the way, in the spirit of Sesame Street the President’s remarks tonight are brought to you by the letter O and the number 16 trillion.”\n\n4. “Campaigns can be grueling, exhausting, President Obama and I are each very lucky to have one person who is always in our corner. Someone who we can lean on and someone who’s a comforting presence without whom we wouldn’t be able to go on with the day. I have my beautiful wife, Ann, he has Bill Clinton.”\n\n5. “Let’s just say that some in the media have a certain way of looking at things. When suddenly I pulled ahead in some of the major polls, what was the headline? “Polls show Obama leading from behind.” And I have already seen early reports from tonight’s dinner,” headline: Obama embraced by Catholics, Romney dines with rich people.”\n\n1. “I’m still making the most of my time in the city, earlier today I went shopping at some stores in Midtown. I understand Governor Romney went shopping for some stores in Midtown.”\n\n2. “It’s been four years since I was last at the Al Smith dinner and I have to admit some things have changed since then. I’ve heard some people say, “Barack, you’re not as young as you used to be. Where is that golden smile, where is that pep in your step?” And I say, ‘Settle down Joe, I’m trying to run a cabinet meeting here.’ He does smile when he says it though.”\n\n3. “Ultimately though, tonight’s not about the disagreements Governor Romney and I may have. It’s what we have in common, beginning with our unusual names. Actually Mitt is his middle name- I wish I could use my middle name.”\n\n4. “Monday’s debate is a little bit different because the topic is foreign policy. Spoiler Alert: We got Bin Laden.”\n\n5. “Of course world affairs are a challenge for every candidate. After- some of you guys remember- after my foreign trip in 2008 I was attacked as a celebrity because I was so popular with our allies overseas and I have to say I am impressed with how well Governor Romney has avoided that problem.”\n\nGet more pure politics at ABCNews.com/Politics and a lighter take on the news at OTUSNews.com", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:55:13.288-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:55:13.288-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2012/10/17/did-obama-really-take-away-those-oil-leases/", "title" : "Did Obama Really Take Away Those Oil Leases?", "text" : "One of the most contentious exchanges in last night’s presidential debate came after President Obama defended his energy strategy against Mitt Romney’s charge that the administration has discouraged drilling on federal lands.\n\nAs Romney and Obama parried over how much, exactly, oil and gas production has fallen on federal property (neither side had its facts entirely right, according to the Houston Chronicle), Obama let loose with this statement that had me scratching my head.\n\nHere’s what happened. You had a whole bunch of oil companies who had leases on public lands that they weren’t using. So what we said was you can’t just sit on this for 10, 20, 30 years, decide when you want to drill, when you want to produce, when it’s most profitable for you. These are public lands. So if you want to drill on public lands, you use it or you lose it. And so what we did was take away those leases. And we are now reletting them so that we can actually make a profit.\n\nReally? Did the government tear up leases that oil companies had paid billions of dollars for and throw the property back on the market?\n\nThe simple answer is no. I’m not sure what Obama was exactly referring to, but there’s no evidence his administration cancelled leases and handed them to different drillers.\n\nWhat his administration has done is repeatedly accuse oil companies of sitting on leases and failing to produce oil and gas from them. It’s a charge that drives the oil industry nuts, since it makes little economic sense to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars or even millions to purchase a lease and then sit on it for no reason. It takes years and a lot of expensive seismic work and exploratory drilling to determine whether an oil deposit has economic value, and the oil industry isn’t in the business of drilling dry holes for the fun of it. If there are delays, industry executives say, it’s because of governmental policy such as the offshore drilling ban Obama issued after the Deepwater Horizon disaster.\n\n“It’s like you rent an apartment for $20 million and the landlord refuses to give you the keys to it,” said Erik Milito, director of exploration and production at the American Petroleum Institute. “Then he turns around and complains about it.”\n\nThe president ordered the Interior Dept. in March 2011 to identify unused acreage on federal lands (it amounts to about 72% of offshore leases and 56% of all federal land in the Lower 48, according to this report) and followed up with policy changes that shortened lease terms and increased the annual holding cost to prod companies into drilling. But did he take away any leases?\n\n“That one puzzled us, too,” said Milito. “If he’s saying he’s taking them away by virtue of the leases expiring, that might be true.”\n\nCompanies abandon their leases all the time, allowing the government to try and sell them to somebody else. The typical offshore lease runs for five to 10 years and like most leases on private lands includes “use it or lose it” clauses that prevent owners from renewing them unless they drill or meet other benchmarks. Oil companies paid the government $4 billion for offshore leases in the Gulf of Mexico from 1996 to 2000, Milito told me, and the government got almost all of them back and released the land for another $6 billion.\n\nThat’s the normal cycle in the oil business, where new technology makes land that was previously uneconomic to drill a potential gusher. Tightening the length of leases might seem like a clever way to prod companies into drilling faster, but the main effect is to drive down how much they’re willing to pay for a look at the land. The entire process of shooting seismic, drilling exploratory wells, getting permits and designing and building production platforms and gathering pipelines can take 10-15 years, so companies aren’t going to spend a lot of money on a 5-year lease that might not have anything worth drilling underneath it.\n\nUse it or lose it?

Was it the fact that he started out with a canned talking point, inserted, perhaps, in the hope that the audience will forget the question?

The president’s clear intent to sidestep Ladka’s inquiry might have prompted activist moderator Candy Crowley to say, Hey, how ‘bout an answer, Mr. President?\n\nShe didn’t, and the conversation careened toward a clash over whether the president had given the country a timely admission that Benghazi was a terrorist attack.\n\nPresident Obama, though, wasn’t done with Kerry Ladka. “After the debate, the president came over to me and spent about two minutes with me privately,” says the 61-year-old Ladka, who works at Global Telecom Supply in Mineola, N.Y. According to Ladka, Obama gave him ”more information about why he delayed calling the attack a terorist attack.” For background, Obama did apparently lump Benghazi into a reference to “acts of terror” in a Sept. 12 Rose Garden address. However, he spent about two weeks holding off on using the full “terrorist” designation. The rationale for the delay, Obama explained to Ladka, was to make sure that the “intelligence he was acting on was real intelligence and not disinformation,” recalls Ladka.\n\nAs to Ladka’s question about who turned down the Benghazi security requests and why, Obama reportedly told him that “releasing the individual names of anyone in the State Department would really put them at risk,” Ladka says.\n\nObama’s retail politics left an impression on Ladka:”I appreciate his private answer more than his public answer,” he says. Spoken like a very genuine undecided voter, Ladka says he wasn’t impressed with Romney’s response to the Libya matter, either.\n\n“I like Obama very much but I am very impressed with Romney’s business background,” says Ladka, who’s not saying in which direction he's leaning.

AFP PHOTO / Saul LOEB (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images) SAUL LOEB\n\nBefore Tuesday night's presidential debate, the satirical newspaper \"The Onion\" ran a story about how President Obama was \"excited to participate in the first debate.\" The joke, of course, was that Mr. Obama's flat, passionless performance in the actual first debate amounted to his not having shown up at all. \n\n\n\nNo one is going to accuse the president of not having shown up this time around. Mr. Obama didn't let the town hall format keep him taking it to his opponent: He came out firing from the outset, effectively calling Mitt Romney a liar offering a \"sketchy deal\" who won't level with the American people. It was the sort of performance that Democrats had been hungry for following the president's passionless initial performance, and one that will reenergize a Democratic base that spent the past two weeks in panic mode.\n\nWhat's not clear is how it will play with uncommitted voters. The CBS News pollof uncommitted voters, taken immediately after the debate, gave Mr. Obama a slight edge, but not a clear win: 37 percent gave the debate to the president, 30 percent gave it to Romney, and 33 percent called it a tie. One lingering question for the president will be whether the aggressive tone turned off those who would have preferred a more civil exchange, among them the female voters that the president needs to win over to have any hope of a second term. \n\n\n\nOf course, Romney wasn't exactly a shrinking violet either. He did his best to take it to the president, at one point curtly stating when interrupted by his rival, \"I'm still speaking.\" There was even a moment, when the two men came nearly toe to toe during a heated and direct argument, that it almost appeared they would come to blows. The debate was exceedingly contentious, particularly considering the town hall setting: A battle between two men who did not appear to like each other and did not mind letting the world know it.\n\nRomney had one particularly strong moment: When he broke down how Mr. Obama has failed to keep many of his first-term promises in a clear and concise fashion. \"This is a president who has not been able to do what he said he'd do,\" Romney said. \"He said that he'd cut in half the deficit. He hasn't done that either. In fact, he doubled it. He said that by now middle-income families would have a reduction in their health insurance premiums by $2,500 a year. It's gone up by $2,500 a year. And if Obamacare is passed, or implemented - it's already been passed - if it's implemented fully, it'll be another $2,500 on top.\"\n\nBut it was Mr. Obama who landed the majority of the blows. Perhaps his finest moment came in response to a question on Libya. This was supposed to be an area of advantage for Romney in light of the administration's bungled response to the terror attack. Instead it was a shining moment for the president, who pivoted to make a memorable case for his toughness as commander-in-chief. \"I said that we'd go after al-Qaeda and bin Laden, we have,\" he said. \"I said we'd transition out of Afghanistan, and start making sure that Afghans are responsible for their own security, that's what I'm doing. And when it comes to this issue, when I say that we are going to find out exactly what happened, everybody will be held accountable. And I am ultimately responsible for what's taking place there because these are my folks, and I'm the one who has to greet those coffins when they come home. You know that I mean what I say.\"\n\nRomney, meanwhile, was reproached by moderator Candy Crowley after he claimed that the president did not label the attack an act of terrorism quickly enough. (Mr. Obama used the phrase \"act of terror\" in his initial remarks in the Rose Garden, though he did not specifically call the incident a terrorist attack.) And Mr. Obama was able to deem Romney's attacks on the issue \"offensive,\" leaving Romney sputtering in response.\n\nThat was the tone all night: After Romney said he would lower gas prices and criticized the president for letting them rise, Mr. Obama was ready with a stinging response: He said that the price of gasoline was so low when he took office because \"some of the same policies that Governor Romney's now promoting\" had tanked the economy. \"So, it's conceivable that Governor Romney could bring down gas prices because with his policies, we might be back in that same mess,\" he said.\n\nMr. Obama was confident, aggressive and detailed all night: He laid out what he said was $8 trillion in proposed tax cuts and spending increases by his rival, and then pointed out in clear language that Romney won't explain how he'll pay for it. \"We haven't heard from the governor any specifics beyond Big Bird and eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood in terms of how he pays for that,\" he said - right after reminding voters that the wealthy GOP nominee had paid only a 14 percent tax rate, which is lower than most Americans believe they pay.\n\nAnd with the help of a favorable string of questions from the town hall audience, the president was able to make a direct and clear case and draw blood on issues that favor him like immigration (Romney's \"top adviser on immigration is the guy who designed the Arizona law, the entirety of it\") and social issues (\"In some ways, [Romney has] gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy\" than President Bush). When Romney tried to land a blow by stating that the president's pension fund included investments in China - Democrats have criticized Romney for having investments in that country - by asking, \"Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?,\" the president had a quick response that squared perfectly with his campaign's portrayal of Romney as an out of touch plutocrat: \"You know, I - I don't look at my pension. It's not as big as yours so it doesn't take as long.\"\n\nAnd the president, who gave a listless closing statement in the first debate, saved up a bomb for his closer Thursday: A reference to Romney's closed door \"47 percent\" comments. Romney tried to head him off at the pass, insisting earlier that he cares \"about 100 percent of the American people,\" but the president got the last word, saying that when his rival \"he said behind closed doors that 47 percent of the country considered themselves victims who refuse personal responsibility,\" he was talking about the veterans, students and soldiers that the president will fight for.\n\nThe debate is unlikely to have the dramatic impact on the race that resulted from the first debate, which elevated Romney to the president's level and prompted a surge in the polls for the Republican nominee. That debate effectively reframed the race, and Tuesday night's performance isn't going to change the fundamentals of the race. But it does appear likely to rally the Democratic base, and, combined with Joe Biden's spirited performance Thursday, potentially shift the momentum back to the Democratic ticket. A CNN poll of registered voters who watched the debate - which the network said had a larger-than-normal sample of Republicans - showed that 46 percent saw the president as the winner, while 39 percent gave the debate to Romney. And while 37 percent said Romney exceeded expectations, 73 percent said the president did so. Romney certainly hung in there, but there's no denying that the president managed to right the ship on Tuesday night. And that should have Democrats breathing a big sigh of relief. \n\n\n\nObama, Romney spar in contentious second debate\n\n\n\nPoll: Obama edges Romney in second debate", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:55:18.846-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:55:18.846-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/12/politics/debate-five-things-learned/index.html", "title" : "Five things we learned from Thursday's vice presidential debate", "text" : "Danville, Kentucky (CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden and Republican Paul Ryan, the man who wants his job, exchanged fire over taxes, Medicare, national security and some animated facial expressions in their only debate before Election Day.\n\nHere are five things we learned from Thursday night:\n\nWe expected Ryan, not Biden, to bring a three-ring binder full of facts and figures to the debate. It's not that the data-driven Ryan didn't show up with an arm full of his statistics; it is just that Biden did so as well.\n\nAnd Biden's aggressive offense from the very beginning drowned out Ryan until about 45 minutes into the debate.\n\nBiden's 36 years in the Senate served him well Thursday night. Who says that delivering hundreds of floor speeches on Capitol Hill isn't useful? The vice president also proved wrong the critics, who predicted he was going to make a gaffe. He didn't.\n\nIn many ways, Biden stole a page from Mitt Romney's debate playbook: put your head down, charge forward and don't stop. Romney effectively employed this strategy last week, and Barack Obama was never able to recover. While Ryan put up a fight last night, he, too, was unable to regain his footing.\n\nThe many expressions of Joe Biden\n\nAn Obama-Biden campaign official said before the debate that the vice president's goal was to try to compare and contrast the two competing campaigns' vision for the future. Whether you agree or disagree with the specifics of the Obama-Biden or Romney-Ryan plans, Biden did a better job of selling his last night.\n\nIt will be several days until we know if this debate has helped the Obama-Biden campaign stem the political bleeding. But Biden did what he needed to do.\n\nIf Biden was on a mission to bring the fight to Ryan, then it appeared to be mission accomplished for the vice president.\n\nMoments into the debate, Biden went on the attack.\n\n\"On Iraq, the president said he would end the war. Gov. Romney said that was a tragic mistake,\" said Biden.\n\nMinutes later the vice president pushed back against criticism by the Wisconsin congressman, saying \"not a single thing he said is accurate.\"\n\nAnd he called other accusations by Ryan \"a bunch of stuff.\"\n\nBiden went where President Barack Obama wouldn't last week in his debate with Romney, bringing up Romney's \"47%\" controversy as well as the Republican nominee's tax rate.\n\nAnd later, when Ryan discussed President John F. Kennedy's tax policies, Biden fired back: \"Oh, now you're Jack Kennedy?\"\n\n\"The vice president came and showed fight. He showed his boss what it is to engage and engage and engage and attack and attack and attack,\" said CNN Chief National Correspondent John King.\n\n\"I think Joe Biden did do his boss a lot of help,\" agreed Senior CNN Political Analyst David Gergen, who's advised both Democratic and Republican presidents.\n\nBut was Biden too aggressive?\n\n\"I think Joe Biden is an authentic person. He speaks his mind. People know him. They expect that,\" Obama senior adviser David Axelrod said. \"I think that authenticity is something that people appreciate.\"\n\n\"The sighing, the eye-rolling, the grinning. I don't know if the vice president knew that there was a camera on him the whole time, that there was a split screen,\" senior Romney campaign adviser Russ Schriefer said. \"Even if we thought he was making good points, I think that they stepped on his good points. He was trying to cram everything in that he could that wasn't in the last debate to try and get it all out at once. But I don't think he made any kind of coherent argument as to why the Obama-Biden ticket should be re-elected.\"\n\nGergen agreed: \"On style I think that Paul Ryan won the debate. The Biden dismissive laughs, the interruptions, the sort of shouting, I think that Ryan was calmer and frankly more presidential.\"\n\nWhat did debate watchers think? Seven out of 10 debate watchers in a CNN/ORC International poll said that Biden was the aggressor.\n\n3. Does the debate even matter?\n\nThe short answer is no.\n\nPeople don't vote for vice presidents at the ballot box. They vote for presidents. Past vice presidential debates, no matter how high the drama, have ultimately done little to move the needle in modern elections.\n\nNot surprisingly, Biden's scenery-chewing performance was viewed differently by both campaigns. The Romney campaign said he looked erratic, rude and unhinged. The Obama campaign said he laid out the facts and made Ryan look, in the spin room words of former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, \"like a lightweight.\"\n\nBut a common refrain from both campaigns after the debate was that it will probably have a minimal effect on the race one way or the other.\n\nThe biggest impact of the night, and the reason Democrats were ebullient after the debate, was the base-rallying impact of Biden's aggressive and blustery stage presence.\n\nIn the wake of Obama's wilting flower routine in last week's debate, the full Biden, exasperated and angry with Romney and Ryan, was just what Democrats needed.\n\nHow happy was team Obama? Campaign surrogates stayed in the spin room with puffed chests for much longer than they did in Denver, when they offered dubious messaging before escaping. The campaign immediately sent out a fundraising plea. President Obama put himself in front of cameras after landing at Andrews Air Force Base to praise Biden's performance.\n\nAnd it wasn't just the Obama camp.\n\nDemocratic state parties, liberal interest groups and down-ballot campaigns rushed to send out fundraising e-mails to capitalize on a fired-up base. You didn't see much of the same on the Republican side.\n\nThe debate launched a fresh news cycle that will put a temporary halt to the \"Chicago in disarray\" storylines. Now the pressure is on President Obama to keep that narrative going next week in New York.\n\nFirst two debates couldn't be more different\n\nIt was arguably Ryan's biggest task in the vice presidential debate.\n\nAs the running mate to the Republican challenger, Ryan needed to convey that he's fit to serve should something happen to the commander in chief, that he would be acceptable to Americans as president.\n\nKnown as an expert on economic and budget issues, early in the debate Ryan showed his smarts on foreign policy. During a discussion on troop drawdowns in Afghanistan, he explained how the seasonal changes affect the fighting in Afghanistan.\n\n\"The mountain passes fill in with snow. The Taliban and the terrorists and the Haqqani and the Quetta Shura come over from Pakistan to fight our men and women. When it fills in with snow, they can't do it. That's what we call fighting seasons. In the warm months, fighting gets really high. In the winter, it goes down,\" explained Ryan.\n\n\"And so when Adm. Mullen and Gen. Petraeus came to Congress and said, if you pull these people out before the fighting season ends, it puts people more at risk. That's the problem.\"\n\n\"I think Ryan proved himself unexpectedly competent on foreign policy,\" said Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos, who worked for Romney's 2008 presidential bid. \"I think Ryan met his test tonight. Ryan looked very reasonable.\"\n\nAs expected, the Obama campaign disagreed.\n\n\"I think Congressman Ryan was out of his depth and showed clearly the ticket is not ready for prime time on foreign policy, and I think that was a decisive difference between the two sides,\" said Obama campaign manager Jim Messina.\n\nSo what do debate watchers think? Did Ryan pass the competency test?\n\nSix out of 10 debate watchers in the CNN/ORC poll conducted said that Ryan is qualified to be president.\n\n\"Malarkey\" is one of Biden's favorite Biden-isms.\n\nHe's been saying it for decades, but not usually with the kind of gusto he showed on Thursday before millions of prime time television viewers.\n\nSoon after the debate began, when Ryan criticized the Obama administration's foreign policy, Biden fired back: \"With all due respect, that's a bunch of malarkey.\"\n\nWhat does malarkey mean?\n\nPeople apparently rushed to their computers to find out. \"Malarkey,\" it turns out, was the third-most-searched debate-related term of the night on Google. It was also trending on Twitter for a good chunk of time.\n\nFor the record: it's basically the Irish-American term for \"nonsense.\"\n\nAccording to Google, the other top searches during the debate were \"Biden,\" \"conflating,\" \"Who is winning the debate\" and \"How old is Paul Ryan.\"\n\nRead a transcript of the debate or watch it online", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:55:21.530-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:55:21.530-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://news.yahoo.com/state-dept-reveals-details-benghazi-attack-062900114.html", "title" : "State Dept reveals new details of Benghazi attack", "text" : "WASHINGTON (AP) — All was quiet outside the U.S. Consulate as evening fell on Benghazi and President Barack Obama's envoy to Libya was retiring after a day of diplomatic meetings.\n\nThere was no indication of the harrowing events that night would bring: assailants storming the compound and setting its buildings aflame, American security agents taking fire across more than a mile of the city, the ambassador and three employees killed and others forced into a daring car escape against traffic.\n\nSenior State Department officials on Tuesday revealed for the first time certain details of last month's tragedy in the former Libyan rebel stronghold, such as the efforts of a quick reaction force that rushed onto the scene and led the evacuation in a fierce gun battle that continued into the streets. The briefing was provided a day before department officials were to testify to a House committee about the most serious attack on a U.S. diplomatic installation since al-Qaida bombed the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania 14 years ago.\n\nThe account answers some questions and leaves others unanswered. Chief among them is why for several days the Obama administration said the assault stemmed from a protest against an American-made Internet video ridiculing Islam, and whether the consulate had adequate security.\n\nThe officials, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said Ambassador Chris Stevens arrived in Benghazi and held meetings on and off the consulate grounds on Sept. 10. He spent the night, and then out of prudence spent the whole of the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks meeting people inside the compound, an enclosed area about 300 yards long by 100 yards wide, with a 9-foot outer wall topped by barbed wire and augmented by barriers, steel drop bars and other security upgrades.\n\nWhen Stevens finished his final meeting of the day, he escorted a Turkish diplomat outside the main entrance of the building. The situation was calm, the officials said, and there were no protests. Five U.S. agents and four local militiamen were providing security.\n\nA little more than an hour later, around 9:40 p.m., everything changed.\n\nThe compound's agents were alerted by loud noises, gunfire and explosions near the front gate. A barracks near the entrance for the local militiamen was burned down. In the control center, agents watched on cameras as a large group of armed men flowed into the compound. They immediately sounded the alarm and made telephone calls to the embassy in Tripoli, officials in Washington, the Libyan authorities and the U.S. quick reaction force located at a second compound a little over a mile away.\n\nOne agent, armed with a sidearm and an assault rifle, took Stevens and State Department computer specialist Sean Smith to a safe room inside one of the compound's two main residences — an area protected by a heavy metal grill and several locks and stocked with medical supplies and water. The other agents rushed to equip themselves with long guns, body armor, helmets and ammunition at other buildings. Two tried to make it to the building with Stevens but took fire and were forced to retreat.\n\nThe attackers began to overrun the compound, the officials recounted. The intruders penetrated Stevens' building and tried to break the grill locks for the safe room but couldn't gain access. So they dumped cans of diesel fuel in the building, lit furniture on fire and set aflame part of the exterior of the building.\n\nIn the compound's other residence, two agents barricaded themselves against the attackers who had gotten inside the building. The attackers failed to enter the tactical operations center, where the last two agents were located, smashing the door but failing to break it.\n\nMeanwhile, Stevens' building rapidly filled with thick diesel smoke and fumes from the burning furniture. Inside, visibility was less than 3 feet and, unable to breathe, the Americans went to a bathroom and opened a window, trying to get air. They decided to get out of the building. The security agent went first, flopping out onto a patio enclosed by sandbags and taking fire immediately.\n\nStevens and Smith didn't make it out, the officials said. The agent, suffering severely from smoke inhalation, went in and out of the building several times to look for them — in vain. He then climbed a ladder to the roof of the building and collapsed, radioing the other agents in a barely audible voice to alert them to the situation there.\n\nThe other four agents were able to then reunite, taking an armored vehicle to Stevens' building. They reached the collapsed agent and tried to set up a perimeter, taking turns going into the building and searching on hands and knees for the missing Americans. Smith was pulled out, dead. Stevens could not be found.\n\nA six-member quick reaction security team arrived on the scene from its compound across town, the officials said. About 60 Libyan militiamen accompanied the team, and it again tried to secure a perimeter around Stevens' building, taking turns searching inside. Taking fire, the Libyan forces determined they couldn't hold the perimeter. An evacuation plan was quickly put in place to retreat to the reaction force's compound.\n\nThe evacuation proved anything but easy. Agents piled into an armored vehicle with Smith's body, facing immediate fire as they left through the main gate. Crowds and groups of men blocked two different routes to the security compound, so the Americans looked for an alternate way through heavy traffic at a speed of about 15 mph, so they wouldn't attract attention.\n\nOn a narrow street, according to officials, the agents reached a group of men who signaled for them to enter a compound. They sensed an ambush and sped away, but not before taking heavy fire from AK-47 machine guns at a distance of only 2 feet and hand grenades thrown against and under the car. Two tires were blown out.\n\nThey raced past another crowd of men and onto a main street, crossing a grassy median into opposing traffic. The agents then drove against oncoming traffic, eventually reaching their compound.\n\nOnce there they had to endure several more hours of intermittent gunfire and rocket-propelled grenades fired their way.\n\nA team of reinforcements from the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli arrived on a chartered aircraft at the Benghazi airport and reached the security compound.\n\nBut the Americans could do little when their main building was hit by mortar fire around 4 a.m. Two security personnel were killed, and one agent who had been involved in the earlier fighting was severely wounded.\n\nThe men decided to leave the city. They spent the next hours securing the annex and moving a large convoy of vehicles to the airport.\n\nThey flew out on two planes.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:55:29.568-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:55:29.568-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/unemployment-rate-plunges-to-78percent/2012/10/05/bdb6e5bc-0ee7-11e2-a310-2363842b7057_story.html", "title" : "Unemployment rate falls to 7.8% in September", "text" : "The professional and business services sector, which consists of jobs such as computer systems design and engineering, saw big gains in March, adding 51,000 jobs.

This year, the demand for visas for skilled foreign workers, a large majority of whom work in the technology sector, is expected to exceed supply.\n\nProfessional and business services The professional and business services sector, which consists of jobs such as computer systems design and engineering, saw big gains in March, adding 51,000 jobs. Most of the jobs were added in the technical sector as well as the administrative and support services subsector. This year, the demand for visas for skilled foreign workers, a large majority of whom work in the technology sector, is expected to exceed supply. Chip Chipman/Bloomberg News\n\nThe economy added only 88,000 jobs in March, the fewest in nine months. The unemployment rate was 7.6 percent, slightly below February’s rate, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Which sectors added more jobs than others? Here’s a look.\n\nThe nation’s jobless rate dropped to its lowest point in nearly four years in September. And unlike some recent declines, this one happened for the right reason: not because people gave up looking for a job, but because far more people reported having one.\n\nIt is a surprising improvement in a job market that had appeared listless in recent months. Although employers added a modest 114,000 jobs in September, the unemployment rate dropped sharply, from 8.1 to 7.8 percent, the government reported Friday.\n\nUnemployment is at its lowest level since President Obama took office in January 2009, offering him a political boost just days after his performance was widely judged as lackluster during a debate against GOP rival Mitt Romney.\n\nThe government said hourly wages were up and employees worked more hours in September, meaning they were taking home bigger checks. Overall, the ratio of the American population with a job reached its highest level since May 2010.\n\nThe drop in the unemployment rate was bolstered by revisions reflecting that employers had added 86,000 more jobs than previously known in July and August, recasting the troubling summer lull in job creation to a season of solid employment gains.\n\nAlthough the report offered a brightening picture of the nation’s labor market, the overall rate of job creation remains less than robust. In addition, unemployment remains far above normal levels, and many millions who have jobs are not working full time.\n\n“While the September employment report was more encouraging than the ones we have seen in recent months, the job market is still a long way from rosy, good health,” said Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist.\n\nThis year, employers have added only slightly more jobs per month than are needed to keep pace with normal labor-force expansion, and slightly fewer than the 153,000 average monthly gain the nation experienced in 2011. Also, the number of Americans working part-time — even though they want full-time jobs — rose sharply last month to 8.6 million.\n\nWith economic growth creeping along after showing signs of more vigorous expansion last year, some economists were skeptical of the magnitude of September’s unemployment decline. A few even predicted that the jobless rate would tick up in the coming months.\n\n“This was a pretty good report, but the drop in the unemployment rate was just too good to be true and probably overstates the degree of improvement in the job market,” said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist for PNC Financial Services Group.\n\nEven at 7.8 percent, the joblessness rate remains high by any historical standard. And it could be years before the economy returns to full employment.\n\nBut Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist for the Economic Outlook Group, said the dichotomy between the recent steep decline in the jobless rate and the slow economic growth in recent months could mean that the economy is poised to take off.\n\nEconomic “growth may turn out to be stronger than most economists currently forecast,” he said. “ . . . Employers are, thus, cautiously turning more optimistic about the economy in 2013 and becoming less apprehensive about hiring.”\n\nThere is evidence that consumers are feeling better about the state of the economy: The Conference Board’s consumer confidence number was up in September, as was a similar University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment.\n\nThe new jobs report was heartily embraced by Obama, who had left many of his supporters feeling anxious after Wednesday night’s presidential debate.\n\n“The unemployment rate has fallen to the lowest level since I took office. More Americans entered the workforce, more people are getting jobs,” Obama said during a rally at George Mason University.\n\nRomney played down the report, saying it reflected, at best, halting improvement. “This is not what a real recovery looks like,” Romney said in a statement. “We created fewer jobs in September than in August, and fewer jobs in August than in July.”\n\nThe September unemployment rate fell dramatically despite the mediocre number of 114,000 jobs created. That’s because the government’s survey of American households — which determines the jobless rate — reported substantially stronger employment gains than a survey of employers — which establishes the overall job number.\n\nSome analysts say this divergence may have been a fluke, while others said it could signal that gains in self-employment and in business start-ups were not captured in the overall job figure.\n\nThe two numbers should even out over time, economists said. About 873,000 more Americans reported having jobs in the survey of households, the largest increase since 1983. About 456,000 fewer people reported not having a job but wanting one.\n\n“The rule of thumb when the two surveys tell different stories in the same month is to give much more weight to what” employers say, said Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute. “Nevertheless, the September household survey provides a reason to be a little more optimistic about job opportunities for American workers than we have been in recent months.”\n\nThe private sector added jobs for the 31st consecutive month, and the long decline in government work that has been a significant drag on the economy is reversing. Federal, state and local government added 10,000 jobs, and revised figures for the previous two months showed an increase of 63,000 public-sector jobs.\n\nThe generally low-paying retail sector added 9,400 jobs last month, while real estate added 7,100, an indication that the housing market is beginning the heal. Restaurants added 15,700 jobs in September, roughly their monthly average over the past year.\n\nManufacturing employment, which has been a bright spot since the recession ended more than three years ago and a focus of the Obama administration, fell by 16,000 jobs in September after dropping by 22,000 the prior month.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:55:30.194-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:55:30.194-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/04/presidential-debate-polls_n_1938021.html", "title" : "Presidential Debate Instant Polls Show Romney Wins", "text" : "WASHINGTON -- Television viewers' snap judgments of the first presidential debate favored Mitt Romney, according to two \"instant reaction\" polls and a focus group conducted during and immediately after the candidates met in Denver.\n\nCBS News, which as in past elections and presidential addresses used the GfK's KnowledgePanel representative Internet panel to interview 523 uncommitted voters who watched the debate (with a reported margin of error of +/- 4 percent). Its sample included voters who were either totally undecided before the debate or who were leaning to a candidate, but said they may still change their minds.\n\nRespondents were unambiguous about who won. By a 46 percent to 22 percent margin, the poll's uncommitted voters said they thought Romney won. After the debate, 56 percent said they had a better opinion of Romney, 11 percent had a worse opinion and 32 percent reported their opinion was unchanged.\n\nFinally, according to results broadcast on CBS, Romney improved his score on the question of \"caring about your needs and problems\" from 30 percent before the debate, to 63 percent after. Obama also improved on this question, from 53 percent to 69 percent.\n\nRomney's support increased modestly among these voters, from 22 percent before the debate to 34 percent after, with most of the change coming from the 50 percent who were totally undecided before the debate. Obama’s support dropped two percentage points, from 25 percent to 23 percent.\n\nCNN, which polled 430 adults who watched the debate and who had agreed to be interviewed after participating in an earlier CNN poll, also found clear evidence of a Romney victory. The survey found that 67 percent thought Romney won the debate, while only 25 percent said they thought Obama won. Thirty-five percent of respondents said they were more likely to vote for Romney after watching the debate, 18 percent for Obama and 47 percent said neither. The percentage of respondents who had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of each candidate was essentially unchanged from CNN's previous poll.\n\nCNN's John King noted that the party breakdown of the network's poll was \"a few points more Republican than a typical poll of all voters,\" but not by enough to hand Romney the victory. The sample included 33 percent Republicans, 37 percent Democrats and 29 percent independents.\n\nRomney also won the expectations-setting game, according to the CNN survey: Most respondents expected Obama to perform better, and for Romney to perform worse than was actually the case. Eighty-two percent of respondents said they thought Romney did a better job than they expected while only 10 percent said they thought he did a worse job than they expected. In contrast, 61 percent said they thought Obama performed worse than they expected and 21 percent said they thought he performed better.\n\nFifty-four percent of respondents said they thought Romney agreed with their views on the size and role of the federal government, while 44 percent said Obama did. Respondents also favored Romney over Obama on handling the economy, health care, taxes, and the federal budget deficit.\n\nDemocracy Corps, a Democratic firm, conducted a debate group with Women's Voices Women Vote Action Fund, with 45 independent voters in Denver. Among the group, 42 percent said Romney won, while 20 percent thought Obama won, and 38 percent said neither candidate did. One-third said they were likely to vote for Obama, compared with 31 percent before the debate. Forty-four percent said they backed Romney, up from 27 percent pre-debate.\n\nThe group showed Romney's favorability went up, from 41 percent before the debate, to 77 percent after. Obama's favorability gained three percentage points. Romney overtook Obama in being seen as a strong leader, and gained points in being seen as better able to handle the economy, and having a clear vision for the country. He made no headway on looking after the middle class, or understanding issues important to voters.\n\nA few caveats for looking at all of these numbers: First, the surveys only reach out to those who watched the debate, who, if history serves, tend to be about a third of all television households. Those most likely to watch are also the most interested in the campaign and most have long since made up their minds.\n\nSecond, historically, even big perceived wins in debate instant-reaction surveys make for modest changes in the polls, although in this case a small change could make a big difference.\n\nEight years ago, Democratic nominee John Kerry was judged the clear winner in his first debate against President George W. Bush in the instant reaction polls conducted by CNN, CBS News and Democracy Corps. Debate viewers also judged Kerry the winner by similar margins the second and third debate as well, and tabulations by partisan affiliation -- not yet available as of this writing for tonight's results -- showed that Kerry scored consistently better with Democrats than Bush did with Republicans.\n\nBush, who like Obama received a significant boost from the party conventions, led Kerry by roughly six percentage points (49.2 percent to 43.3 percent) on the average of Real Clear Politics polling averages from Sept. 4 to Sept. 30. Kerry's support increased slightly immediately after the first debate and cut Bush's lead to 2.4 percentage points on the RealClearPolitics averages reported from Oct. 4 through election day.\n\nThe 2012 race may not follow the contours of 2004, but if it does, we are in for a very close finish. Kerry's debate performances cut Bush's lead by 3.5 percentage points.\n\nAs of this writing, the HuffPost Pollster poll tracking model shows Obama leading by 4.2 percentage points (48.7 percent to 44.5 percent).", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:55:32.732-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:55:32.732-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57525700/debate-analysis-romney-lands-blows-against-cautious-obama/?tag=currentVideoInfo;videoMetaInfo", "title" : "Debate analysis: Romney lands blows against cautious Obama", "text" : "The first presidential debate of the 2012 general election cycle may have been the best night of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign.\n\nRomney entered the debate trailing the president in polls of battleground states, giving him incentive to be aggressive in order to close the gap against President Obama. And he was indeed aggressive, trotting out the much-discussed \"zingers\" he prepared ahead of time (\"As president you're entitled to your own house, your own plane, but not your own facts\") and repeatedly (if not always factually) attacking Mr. Obama's record. He was enough of an alpha presence on stage that critics quickly took to attacking the debate moderator, Jim Lehrer, for letting Romney dictate the flow of the debate - despite the fact that he actually spoke for about four-and-a-half minutes less than the president.\n\nMr. Obama, meanwhile, entered the debate with an incentive to be cautious and protect his apparent lead. And cautious he was. The president made no mention of Romney's infamous \"47 percent\" comments or his rival's record at Bain Capital, despite the fact that his campaign has been hitting Romney hard on both issues. It's understandable that the president would not want to risk coming off as mean-spirited toward his opponent in light of his frontrunner status. But his decision not to try to put Romney on the defensive meant Romney often seemed to be in control of the conversation. And that had the effect of elevating the challenger into someone who appeared very much to belong onstage with the president of the United States.\n\nTo be clear, the debate was by no means a disaster for the president. He had some strong moments, particularly when he criticized Romney's plan to turn Medicare into a voucher-like program and noted that \"Romneycare\" looks an awful lot like \"Obamacare.\" Mr. Obama avoided any major gaffes, as did his challenger. But his body language left something to be desired - too much looking down at the podium, too little energy - and at one point he appeared snippy when Lehrer tried to cut him off, complaining, \"I had five seconds before you interrupted me.\" Romney was not perfect - he tended to smirk while the president was speaking, for one thing - but he won the battle of appearances overall. And that particularly matters in a wonky debate like this one, when phrases like \"Dodd-Frank\" and \"Simpson-Bowles\" were casually thrown around despite the fact that many viewers have little-to-no familiarity with them.\n\nIt's not as though the president didn't have openings to put his opponent on the defensive. In addition to the \"47 percent\" comments and Romney's record at Bain, Mr. Obama could have brought up Romney's low personal tax rate when the discussion turned to the GOP nominee's opposition to raising takes on the wealthy. When Romney went after the president for taking more than $700 billion out of Medicare, Mr. Obama could have pointed out that Romney's running mate offered a plan to do the very same thing. Instead, the president largely tried to stay above the fray even as his rival was landing body blows. When the president did offer up an attack it felt halfhearted, as when he less-than-artfully criticized Romney for a lack of specifics. And when he tried to offer up a memorable line - such as invoking Donald Trump as the sort of small-business owner Romney wants to help - it fell flat.\n\nIt already appears clear that Mr. Obama's cautious strategy was a mistake. In a CBS News instant poll of 523 uncommitted voters conducted shortly after the debate, 46 percent chose Romney as the winner - compared to 22 percent for the president. (The rest thought it was a tie.) And 56 percent now think better of Romney than they did before the debate. The Obama campaign spent months running ads and offering rhetoric to define Romney negatively in the eyes of the American people. But on one of the biggest nights of the campaign, when a significant portion of viewers were tuning in for the first time, he often held fire and let his rival do the defining for himself.\n\nOver the past month, it has often appeared that the race was starting to get away from Romney - and the media seemed to be getting close to effectively declaring the contest over. All that changed Wednesday night. Romney exceeded expectations and came off as a credible alternative to a president who must overcome a sluggish economic recovery and an unemployment rate that remains over eight percent. Romney came off as reasonable, pragmatic and respectful, not the cartoonish millionaire extremist that the Obama campaign has been portraying. The debate isn't going to fundamentally change the course of the race. But it is likely going to give Romney a bump, and, just as importantly, change the tenor of the media coverage. The days of Romney being portrayed as a bumbler as a result of his campaign missteps are over, at least for now.

But the technology required to get a guy well on his way to outer space, then allow him to plummet safely back to Earth, deserves some credit, too.\n\nFrom the one-of-a-kind Red Bull Stratos capsule to a pressurized space suit engineered specifically for the jump to a \"smart\" parachute designed to deploy if Baumgartner had spiraled out of control, the jump debuted tech that organizers say could contribute to the science world in other areas.\n\nAfter space jump, what's the next big stunt?\n\nHere is a look at some of the most interesting gadgetry used during the record-breaking leap:\n\nAt 2,900 pounds, the Stratos weighs in at slightly more than a modern Volkswagen Beetle.\n\nIt's made of a fiberglass and epoxy \"pressure sphere,\" the same kind of steel alloy (chromium-molybdenum) cage used in racecars, a foam-insulated fiberglass shield that protected Baumgartner from temperatures as low as -70 degrees Fahrenheit and a base covered in \"crush pads\" designed to handle 8 Gs of impact pressure.\n\nEngineers on the project say Baumgartner's spacesuit-style uniform could serve as a model for the future of space travel and exploration.\n\nThe fully pressurized suit was tested to withstand temperatures as high as 100 degrees Fahrenheit and, more importantly in Baumgartner's case, as low as -90 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWhy was the 3.5 pounds of pressure in the suit important? Because, according to the Stratos team, tissues in Baumgartner's body could have turned to gas and expanded while he was above 62,000 feet. Not good.\n\nThe most innovative aspects of the suit, however, might have been those designed for mobility and vision. A skydiver needs the ability to move around more quickly than, say, an astronaut tethered to the outside of the international space station.\n\nThe Stratos suit was modified to allow more mobility and a system of mirrors increased visibility. A hockey puck-sized controller is programmed to adjust pressure based on the suit's current altitude and a new kind of rotating, locking ring attached the helmet and gloves to the rest of the suit.\n\nBaumgartner's helmet was an 8-pound composite mold attached to a pair of oxygen cylinders during his descent. Its visor was equipped with an integrated heating unit to prevent fogging and icing.\n\nThe nerve center of Baumgartner's gear was a chest pack where most of the high-tech gadgetry he'd need to complete, and document, the jump was stored.\n\nData recorders inside it reported his altitude, speed and location to mission control to help them monitor his progress and whereabouts. The pack also contained a GPS beacon to make him easier to find.\n\nThe voice transmitter and receiver that connected to his helmet were in the chest pack, as was an HD camera with a 120-degree view.\n\nThat chest pack camera wasn't the only one devoted to documenting the historic leap.\n\nStill and video cameras were designed specifically for the mission by Jay Nemeth of FlightLine Films. Nemeth is one of a handful of photographers with experience shooting in zero-gravity, including a shoot with Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin.\n\nThere were nine high-definition cameras in the capsule, three high-resolution still cameras and three digital cinematography cameras with lens resolution of 4,000 x 2,000-pixels.\n\nIn addition to Baumgartner's chest-pack camera, he also had one attached to each thigh.\n\nThe cameras were modified in a host of the ways for the unique needs of the mission -- from pressurized casings filled with nitrogen to protect them from the extreme temperatures to special filters to protect them from the brightness of the sun at that altitude (iPhone 5 owners take note).\n\nThe parachute itself was a tech marvel five years in the making.\n\nThe first personal parachute ever used for a supersonic-speed fall, it weighs 60 pounds, or three times as much as a normal parachute.\n\nIt included a \"drogue chute\" that could have deployed if Baumgartner began spinning out of control. He had a button on one of his gloves that would have caused the chute to open if he held it down for three seconds. That parachute (which is separate from the regular emergency chute) also would have deployed if it was being hit by unexpectedly high levels of pressure for more than six seconds.\n\nHis rig also included a button to cut the emergency parachute. While it would just be an inconvenience for many skydivers, if Baumgartner's emergency chute accidentally deployed at a high altitude, it could have slowed him down so much that he ran out of oxygen.\n\nHow was Baumgartner able to control where he landed?\n\nFor starters, the skydiver remained within the Earth's atmosphere, so he never had to account for the planet rotating underneath him. His team waited for ideal weather conditions, when there were fewer high-altitude winds that might have caused his balloon to drift.\n\nAnd once he deployed his parachute, less than two miles above the Earth, Baumgartner was able to steer himself to a flat, open landing spot in the New Mexico desert -- some 23 miles east of where the balloon had taken off several hours earlier. A beacon inside his suit allowed his recovery helicopter to follow him.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:55:45.516-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:55:45.516-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/felix-baumgartner-breaks-sound-barrier-as-he-jumps-from-edge-of-space/story-e6frea6u-1226495536138", "title" : "Felix Baumgartner breaks sound barrier as he jumps from edge of space", "text" : "Felix Baumgartner breaks sound barrier as he jumps from edge of space\n\nThe speed, revealed at a press conference after the unprecedented leap from 39km up, was significantly higher than that given earlier by a spokeswoman, who had put his maximum speed as 1136km/h.\n\nNo one has ever reached that speed wearing only a high-tech suit.\n\nThe 43-year-old floated down to Earth on a red and white parachute canopy.\n\nAt the press conference, Baumgartner also spoke of some of the problems he encountered during the record-breaking jump, including fogging on his helmet visor, which coud have aborted the mission and a flat spin as he fell.\n\n\"When I was standing there on top of the world, you become so humble, you do not think about breaking records anymore, you do not think about gaining scientific data. The only thing you want is to come back alive,'' he said after the jump.\n\nBaumgartner says that traveling faster than sound is \"hard to describe because you don't feel it.''\n\nWith no reference points, \"you don't know how fast you travel,'' he told reporters.\n\n\"Sometimes we have to get really high to see how small we are,'' he said.\n\nMission control erupted in cheers as Baumgartner made a near-perfect jump from a capsule hoisted aloft by a giant helium-filled balloon to an altitude of around 128,000 feet (39km).\n\n\"Sometimes you have (go) up really high to (realise) how small you are,\" Baumgartner said shortly before he jumped, watched in live footage beamed around the world.\n\n\"I think 20 tons have fallen from my shoulders. I prepared for this for seven years,'' he told German-language ServusTV in Austria in his first interview after the leap.\n\nMore than eight million people watched the livestream of Baumgartner's jump on Red Bull's YouTube channel.\n\nThe video sharing site posted on its blog that as well as his other records Baumgartner's now held the record for \"creating a livestream with the most concurrent views ever on YouTube\".\n\nMashable reported the Austrian diver had already broken an online record before he even jumped with 7.1 million people watching in anticipation of the freefall dive.\n\nThe 'live' online feed of the jump was delayed by 20 seconds in case something happened to daredevil Baumgartner.\n\nTalkback radio in Australia operates on just a seven second delay, which is enough time for producers to cut any caller who makes vulgar or defamatory comments.\n\nIt is unclear why the Stratos producers needed the full 20 seconds. One theory doing the rounds is that if Baumgartner got into trouble, it would have been difficult to tell if he was unconscious or just falling in an ungainly manner.\n\nA few extra seconds would have proved handy in allowing the crew to analyse data from its 30 cameras on the ground, in the capsule and aboard a helicopter.\n\nFortunately, the mission was a great success so the delay proved to be nothing more than a sensible precaution.\n\nReferring to a helmet problem that nearly forced him to abort the mission at the last minute, Baumgartner said: \"Even on a day like this when you start so well, then there's a little glitch.\n\n\"And you think you'll have to abort -- what if you've prepared everything and it fails on a visor problem. But I finally decided to jump. And it was the right decision.''\n\nHe had taken more than two hours to get up to the jump altitude. Baumgartner had already broken one record, before he even leapt: the previous highest altitude for a manned balloon flight was 113,740 feet, set in 1961.\n\nThe Austrian had been due to jump from 120,000 feet, but the balloon went higher than expected, to 39 kilometers.\n\nThe Red Bull Stratos mission was the second attempt for the skydiver after an initial bid last week was aborted at the last minute due to winds.\n\nThe biggest risk Baumgartner faced was spinning out of control, which could exert G forces and make him lose consciousness. A controlled dive from the capsule was essential, putting him in a head-down position to increase speed.\n\nMore gruesomely, the skydiver's blood could have boiled if there were the slightest tear or crack in his pressurized spacesuit-like outfit, due to instant depressurisation at the extreme altitude.\n\nTemperatures of minus 68 Celsius could also have had unpredictable consequences if his suit somehow failed.\n\nThe leap went off flawlessly though there was a minor problem as the capsule ascended: a heater failed on Baumgartner's helmet faceplate, meaning it was becoming fogged up when he exhaled.\n\nAfter considering the options they decided to go ahead with the jump.\n\nBaumgartner's 100-strong backup team includes retired US Air Force colonel Joe Kittinger, who had held one of the records he was trying to break: the highest freefall jump, which he made from 102,800 feet (31,333 metres) in 1960.\n\n\"Let the guardian angel take care of you,\" Kittinger told Baumgartner shortly before he leapt into the void.\n\nThe giant balloon - which holds 30 million cubic feet of helium - is needed to carry the Red Bull Stratos capsule to the stratosphere.\n\nIt is made of near transparent polyethylene strips even thinner than a dry cleaner bag, which are heat-sealed together. Very thin material is necessary to save weight.\n\nThe Austrian has been training for five years for the jump. He holds several previous records, notably with spectacular base jumps from the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur and the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\nThe jump was a hit on social media, with Twitter, YouTube and Facebook going into overdrive.\n\nHere's a look at how the world, through the Internet, watched the jump.\n\nYOUTUBE: As Baumgartner ascended in the balloon, so did the number of viewers watching YouTube's live stream of the event.\n\nIts popularity grew as the moment of the jump drew closer, as people kept sharing links with each other on Twitter and Facebook and websites embedded the stream.\n\nNearly 7.3 million viewers were watching as Baumgartner sat on the edge of the capsule, moments before the jump.\n\nIn the United States, the opportunity to watch the jump on TV was limited to the Discovery Channel, though more than 40 television networks in 50 total countries carried the live feed, organizers said. It was streamed by more than 130 digital outlets.\n\nFACEBOOK: After Baumgartner landed, sponsor Red Bull posted a picture of the daredevil on his knees to Facebook.\n\nIn less than 40 minutes, the picture was shared more than 29,000 times and generated nearly 216,000 likes and more than 10,000 comments. Immediately after the jump, Red Bull solicited questions for Baumgartner through Facebook and Twitter, promising to answer three at a post-jump news conference.\n\nTWITTER: During the jump and the moments after Baumgartner safely landed, half the worldwide trending topics on Twitter had something to do with the jump - pushing past tweets about Justin Bieber and seven National Football League games being played at the same time. Celebrities of all kinds weighed in, including athletes, actors and high-profile corporate executives.\n\n``It's pretty amazing that I can watch, live on my computer, a man riding a balloon to the edge of space so he can jump out of it. #TheFuture,'' tweeted Wil Wheaton, who acted in the iconic science-fiction series Star Trek: The Next Generation.'\n\n``Felix Baumgartner is a boss,'' tweeted Jozy Altidore, a soccer player for the U.S. men's national team.\n\nREDDIT: Two threads related to the jump made the front page of Reddit.\n\nUsers quickly upvoted a request for Baumgartner to participate in an ``Ask Me Anything'' on the site, where users pepper someone on the site with questions about anything they want.\n\nPresident Barack Obama held court as the subject of a similar thread in August.\n\nNearly 29,000 users weighed in on a separate thread about the jump itself, voting it up and down and robustly commenting.\n\nSpeaking before the launch, Baumgartner said he would be proud to be the first person to break the speed of sound in freefall.\n\n\"But really, I know that part of this entire experience will help make the next pressure suit safer for space tourists and aviators,\" the jumper pointed out.\n\nThe launch coincided with the 65th anniversary of American pilot Chuck Yeager breaking the speed of sound.\n\n\"I warmly congratulate Felix Baumgartner on this great success, which was achieved with courage and perseverance and is finding worldwide attention,'' President Heinz Fischer reacted on his Facebook page almost immediately after Baumgartner had landed safely in New Mexico.\n\n\"Austria is proud of your accomplishment,'' he added.\n\nChancellor Werner Faymann also hailed the achievement in a statement.\n\n\"His jump from a height of around 39 kilometres was a fascinating event for millions of people worldwide,'' Faymann said.\n\n\"But I'm first and foremost happy everything went well.\n\n\"I congratulate Felix Baumgartner and his team for this impressive achievement.

A controlled dive from the capsule is essential, putting him in a head-down position to increase speed.\n\nMore worrying is the prospect that the skydiver's blood could boil if there were the slightest tear or crack in his pressurized spacesuit-like outfit, due to instant depressurization at extreme altitude.\n\nTemperatures of 90 degrees below zero Fahrenheit (minus 68 Celsius) could also have unpredictable consequences if his suit somehow fails.\n\n", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:56:02.114-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:56:02.114-0400" } } ] },{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5414e8502c243f649770364c" }, "title" : "Cameron, Salmond sign deal for referendum on Scottish independence", "articles" : [ { "ext_url" : "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-19959597", "title" : "Scottish independence: Referendum campaigners put their arguments", "text" : "The leaders of the no and yes referendum campaigns on Scottish independence have been putting their cases ahead of the historic vote.\n\nAlistair Darling of the Better Together unionist group said independence was \"not freedom but more like serfdom\".\n\nBlair Jenkins, who heads up the Yes lobby, said he was \"enormously excited\" about the referendum in autumn 2014.\n\nThe comments came the day after a deal on the process of the vote was signed by the UK and Scottish governments.\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron and First Minister Alex Salmond met at St Andrew's House in Edinburgh to agree to the memorandum of understanding laying out the ground rules.\n\nThe vote in two years time will consist of;\n\nFormer BBC Scotland news chief Mr Jenkins said: \"How fantastic is it that we are the first generation of Scots - the only generation of Scots - to get a chance to vote on this issue and we could leave a better bequest to our children, grandchildren and future generations to come then being an independent Scotland.\"\n\nHe Told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that there was a big challenge ahead for the Yes campaign given that current polling suggests people in Scotland would vote against independence.\n\nMr Jenkins explained: \"There is already a group in the population who is firmly intending to vote yes and a group firmly intending to vote no and there is a very sizeable group, I think the largest of the three groups, who are saying we have not made up our minds, we are interested in this idea, we want to hear more, we need to be convinced.\n\n\"Now our job is very clear, we've got the evidence, we've got the arguments.\"\n\nHe admitted that people were not fully in tune with the debate, but conversations were beginning right across Scotland.\n\nMr Jenkins said it was possible to see everyone in Scotland as \"converts to independence\".\n\nBut former Labour chancellor and pro-unionist Mr Darling said the arguments were stacked against Scotland becoming independent.\n\nHe told Good Morning Scotland that there were three strong elements as to why the UK should remain together - the economy, emotional and cultural ties and the influence the UK has in the world.\n\nMr Darling added: \"If Scotland became independent it has got to have its own financial services regulatory regime.

The United Kingdom is made up of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Devolution essentially means the transfer of powers from the UK parliament in London to assemblies in Cardiff and Belfast, and the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Public votes were held in 1997 in Scotland and Wales, and a year later in both parts of Ireland. This resulted in the creation of the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly. Devolution applied in different ways in each nation due to historical and administrative differences. The table below gives an overview of the main powers given to the Northern Irish and Welsh assemblies, and the Scottish Parliament. *Scotland has always had its own legal system More on devolution from BBC Democracy Live What powers are not devolved? The UK government is responsible for national policy on all powers which have not been devolved. These are known usually as \"reserved powers\" and include foreign affairs, defence, international relations and economic policy. This table gives an overview of the main non-devolved powers. + - Non-devolved powers in Wales are by implication all those not set out in the 2006 Government of Wales Act The Westminster Parliament is technically still able to pass laws for any part of the UK, but in practice only deals with devolved matters with the agreement of the devolved governments. The Northern Ireland Assembly sits at Stormont in Belfast Devolution here is slightly different to Scotland and Wales, with government powers divided into three categories: transferred, reserved and excepted. The power-sharing agreement between the Nationalist and Unionist communities in Northern Ireland is critical to the functioning of the assembly; devolution of powers has been suspended and reinstated several times since its inception in 1998. In addition to the main devolved powers shown in the table, the assembly can also legislate on culture, arts and leisure, learning and employment and regional and social development. In March 2010, an agreement was passed to transfer powers of justice and policing to Northern Ireland. Reserved powers - which could be transferred in the future with cross-community consent - include prisons and civil defence. A third category - excepted powers - includes matters such as parliamentary and assembly elections, international relations and defence. These cannot be transferred without primary legislation from Westminster. The Scottish parliament is based at Holyrood in Edinburgh Scotland has a \"parliament\" as opposed to an \"assembly\" - the crucial difference being that Holyrood is a legislation-making body, passing bills in various areas of its many devolved responsibilities. The Scottish parliament also has the power to raise or lower the basic rate of income tax by 3p in the pound - although this so-called \"Tartan Tax\" has never been used. In addition to the main devolved powers shown in the table, the parliament can legislate on tourism, economic development, planning, natural and built heritage, sport and the arts, as well as statistics, public registers and records. The primary powers retained by Westminster include foreign policy, defence and trade and industry. The Welsh Assembly building is in Cardiff The Government of Wales Act of 2006 gives the Welsh assembly powers to make its own laws, but limits its scope to defined \"fields\"; a broad subject area such as education or health. Within these fields, the assembly is able to enact its own laws, known as measures. The major areas in which the assembly can legislate are listed in the table above. In addition, the assembly can make laws relating to ancient monuments and historic buildings, public administration, sport and recreation, tourism, town and country planning, flood defences, the assembly itself, and the Welsh language. By omission, anything not contained in the current list of measures remains under the control of the Parliament in Westminster. The assembly is split into executive and legislative branches: the Welsh assembly government controls day-to-day running of devolved policy areas within the country, while the National Assembly for Wales scrutinises and debates the assembly government's work. The assembly could increase its powers in the future and may one day evolve into a body similar to the Scottish Parliament. In February 2010, assembly members voted in favour of holding a referendum on devolving further powers from Westminster. This motion must now gain approval from both Houses of Parliament. Why is there not an 'English parliament'? The UK government is responsible for all matters in England which have been devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. However devolution has caused some tensions, particularly over public spending. The new powers of the Scottish Parliament have allowed it to abolish university tuition fees and prescription charges. These services are not free in England. However Scotland's public services are still paid for by all UK taxpayers under the terms of the Barnett formula, which allocates funding around different parts of the country. Some in England are increasingly unhappy, seeing this as English taxpayers subsidising free services in Scotland. A recent survey of 980 people by the left-leaning think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research suggested 40% of those questioned believe this situation unfair, compared with 22% in 2003. Delivering the report, Professor John Curtice said if the trends continued, politicians \"may no longer be able to safely assume that England can be ignored in the devolution debate\". \n\n\n\n", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:58:56.265-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:58:56.265-0400" } } ] },{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5414e8582c243f649770364d" }, "title" : "Attorney General vetos release of Prince Charles correspondence", "articles" : [ { "ext_url" : "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19959233", "title" : "Attorney general vetoes Prince Charles letters publication", "text" : "Attorney General Dominic Grieve has blocked the release of private letters the Prince of Wales sent to seven government departments.\n\nA court ruled last month that the correspondence should be published.\n\nBut Mr Grieve said it was an exceptional case where the letters formed part of the prince's \"preparations for kingship\".\n\nThe Guardian said it would seek to take the government to the High Court to challenge the veto .\n\nThe Republic group called the ruling an \"affront to democracy\" which was \"all about protecting Charles and the Royal Family from scrutiny\".\n\nIn his report, Mr Grieve said: \"The ability of the Monarch to engage with the government of the day, whatever its political colour, and maintain political neutrality is a cornerstone of the UK's constitutional framework.\"\n\nThe Administrative Appeals Chamber said last month that in its view, it was in the public interest \"for there to be transparency as to how and when Prince Charles seeks to influence government\".\n\nContinue reading the main story Prince Charles and his officials will be relieved the government has come to the aid of the future king.

However, it served only to reinforce the view that he sought to influence policy.\n\nThe Information Commissioner, Christopher Graham, said he was “concerned” that the Government had overturned the decision of an appeals tribunal. Anti-monarchist groups said Mr Grieve was “protecting” the Prince and putting his rights above those of the public. Three judges of the Upper Tribunal of the Administrative Appeals Chamber had overturned the Information Commissioner’s previous decision not to order the release of the letters, written between Sept 1, 2004 and April 1, 2005.\n\nThe judges decided that the letters to the Departments for Business, Health, Education, Environment, Culture, Northern Ireland and the Cabinet Office should be released after The Guardian newspaper applied for them under the Freedom of Information Act in 2005.\n\nThe content of the “black spider” letters, so called because of the Prince’s scratchy handwriting, is not known, but the Prince has in the past written to ministers about subjects as diverse as GM crops and the NHS.\n\nIn a 10-page summary of his reasons for overturning the judges’ decision, Mr Grieve said the Prince’s letters had been “urging a particular view on ministers” but this amounted to him “educating” himself about the work of government in preparation for becoming king, making the letters exempt from freedom of information requests.\n\nHe said it was vital that the Prince maintained political neutrality, “a cornerstone of the UK’s constitutional framework”, and any suggestion that he was “disagreeing with government policy” would be “seriously damaging to his role as future monarch”.\n\nHe added: “The letters … are in many cases particularly frank. They also contain remarks about public affairs which would, in my view, if revealed, have had a material effect upon the willingness of the Government to engage in correspondence with the Prince of Wales, and would potentially have undermined his position of political neutrality.”\n\nMr Grieve said there was “nothing improper” in the letters, but said there was an overwhelming argument against disclosing them, “centred upon the Prince of Wales’s preparation for kingship and the importance of not undermining his future role as sovereign”.\n\nHe concluded that the letters should be exempt from the Freedom of Information Act because of “the potential damage that disclosure would do to the principle of the Prince of Wales’s political neutrality, which could seriously undermine the Prince’s ability to fulfil his duties when he becomes king”. Rob Evans, the journalist who applied for the release of the letters seven years ago, described the decision as “appalling”, and The Guardian said it would challenge decision in the High Court.\n\nGraham Smith, the chief executive of the anti-monarchy group Republic, said: “The Attorney General’s decision is all about protecting Charles and the Royal family from scrutiny, putting his demands above the rights of the British people.”\n\nThe Freedom of Information Act was amended in 2010 to give the heir to the throne exemption from all future requests.

These are the ­interventions we know about, but there may be others.\"\n\nNow Rogers has decided to fight back against the prince's influence, and today demands a public inquiry into the constitutional ­validity of Charles's ­interventions on this project, in architecture more widely, as well as in his other areas of interest including ­medicine, farming and the environment.\n\n\"This sort of situation is totally unconstitutional and should never ­happen again,\" he said .\n\nOver the weekend, as the dust ­settled on the prince's latest attack, the ­Rogers household was inundated with calls of moral support. The sculptor Anish Kapoor was among the artists and ­writers who called and helped galvanise Rogers to call for action against Charles.\n\n\"They've called in saying, it's you today, but who is next?\" said Ruth ­Rogers, the architect's wife, who runs the River Cafe restaurant next to his offices. \"The prince's actions are akin to calling up a publisher and saying I want all books to have happy endings or ­saying to the Guardian, I don't like ­colour photography, let's go back to sepia.\"\n\nBut as with any architect, the first thing Rogers wanted to talk about was his firm's design for Chelsea barracks, which, he tantalisingly said, could have been \"one of the best schemes my office has ever produced\". That is quite a claim for a firm which won the 2007 Stirling prize for Madrid airport.\n\nOpponents described the Chelsea ­barracks project as a series of glass and steel towers, but Rogers emphasised it would have risen only to nine storeys. He is proud of the ban on cars at surface level, the large open spaces, and the copper, glass and concrete walls which would have been coloured to blend with the surrounding architectural styles from Georgian, through Victorian to 20th and 21st century design.\n\nFar from being \"a Gucci ghetto\" for super-rich ­oligarchs as the project was originally labelled, he said he had ­managed to \"de-Guccify\" it by ensuring public access 24 hours a day and 50% affordable housing. Public consultation was extensive with at least 80 meetings, he said.\n\nWith such obvious pride in the scheme, it raises the question why ­Rogers, or no one else, spoke up for it when the prince was giving it a public kicking, via the leaking of his private ­letter to Qatar's royal family.\n\n\"When the Qataris took full control about nine months ago, I was told to keep out of the limelight and stay quiet,\" said Rogers.\n\n\"There was no major public relations strategy. It gave us the feeling they didn't understand that this was a democratic process. The Qataris never sorted out the difference between royalty and government.\"\n\nIt was to be a misunderstanding that Rogers believes Charles exploited. He asked \"prince to prince\" for an ­alternative design to be adopted and it is thought this was hugely influential in Qatar where royalty and government are the same thing. Aides to the Qatari royal family said they felt the prince's ­opposition could undermine the ­diplomatic advantage they hoped to gain in the UK by investing in such a prominent site.\n\nWithout any resistance to the ­criticism from Charles, a small campaign group against the Rogers scheme, the Chelsea Barracks Opposition Group, was able to monopolise the argument and praised the Prince of Wales for standing up for the ordinary people of the area and resisting an alien project.\n\n\"The idea that he is a man of the ­people fascinates me,\" said Rogers. \"He is a man of the rich people, that is for sure.\n\n\"Up to two months ago we were pretty convinced we were going to get our scheme through Westminster's planning committee. We enjoyed some of the strongest support I have ever had from Westminster and the Greater London authority, including the great report we had only last week from the planners, which is why I thought we were home and dry. I just don't know what happened.\"\n\nTonight, Clarence House refused to be drawn on Rogers's comments, saying \"we don't want to get into a debate with Richard Rogers,\" and this is at the heart of the architect's frustration.\n\n\"Charles knows little about architecture,\" said Rogers. \"He sees this debate as a battle of the styles, which is against the run of history because architecture evolves and moves, mirroring society. It is not a frozen thing, though if it was I have to say, why choose the 17th century as the prince seems to. I would say gothic is more English than the ­renaissance, but I wouldn't say we should all follow gothic style.\n\n\"By the same token, the prince's love for Christopher Wren is clear, but he doesn't seem to realise that Wren was a revolutionary at the time and I think his projects would definitely not have been supported by the prince.\"\n\nIn a scathing attack on Charles's search for a meaningful role, Rogers said: \"The prince does not debate and in a democracy that is unacceptable and in fact is non-constitutional. I think he pursues these topics because he is looking for a job and in that sense I sympathise with him. He is actually an unemployed individual, which says something about the state of the royal family. I don't think he is evil per se, he is just misled.\"", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:59:04.948-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:59:04.948-0400" } } ] },{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5414e86f2c243f649770364e" }, "title" : "Car bomb hits centre of Beirut", "articles" : [ { "ext_url" : "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20016372", "title" : "Anger erupts as Lebanon mourns Beirut bomb victims", "text" : "A day of national mourning has been held in Lebanon amid opposition protests over a massive car bombing a day earlier in Beirut.\n\nThe dead included internal intelligence chief Wissam al-Hassan, who was close to the anti-Syrian opposition.\n\nProtesters have been blocking roads in Beirut and other cities.

He was detained on charges of collaborating with members of the Syrian government to import explosives and launch attacks in Lebanon.

Some Lebanese political leaders have already accused the Assad regime in Syria of being behind the attack, even though it is still too early to say who is responsible.

He was a leading Democrat who came from Republican roots. He was a politician who cared more about being on the right side of an issue than on the popular side.\n\nGeorge Stanley McGovern -- a staunch liberal who served South Dakota in the U.S. Senate and House for more than two decades and who ran unsuccessfully as the Democratic Party nominee for president in 1972 -- died Sunday at the age of 90, his family said.\n\n\"Our wonderful father, George McGovern, passed away peacefully at the Dougherty Hospice House in Sioux Falls, SD, surrounded by our family and life-long friends,\" his family said in a statement.\n\n\"We are blessed to know that our father lived a long, successful and productive life advocating for the hungry, being a progressive voice for millions and fighting for peace.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama praised McGovern as someone who showed a lifelong love of country.\n\n\"When the people of South Dakota sent him to Washington, this hero of war became a champion for peace,\" the president said in a written statement. \"And after his career in Congress, he became a leading voice in the fight against hunger. George was a statesman of great conscience and conviction.\"\n\nOthers remembered him for the changes he brought to politics.\n\n\"I think he'll be remembered, obviously, for his stance on the war in Vietnam,\" said Bill Richardson, the former governor of New Mexico, \"but also for his contributions on agriculture, on hunger.\n\n\"And then the Democratic Party. He transformed the party, the primary system, getting minorities involved. He was a gigantic figure and a classy, good, good guy.\"\n\nFuneral services are scheduled to take place in Sioux Falls on Friday, one day after a public viewing in the same city.\n\nBill and Hillary Clinton said they first met McGovern while campaigning for him in 1972. The former president and current secretary of state said McGovern never stopped speaking out for the causes he believed in.\n\n\"We must continue to draw inspiration from his example and build the world he fought for,\" the Clintons said in a written statement. \"The world has lost a tireless advocate for human rights and dignity.\"\n\nThe son of a Methodist minister who was a Republican, McGovern was born in Avon, South Dakota, on July 19, 1922. Six years later, his family moved an hour north to Mitchell, where McGovern graduated from Mitchell High School in 1940.\n\nHis debating skills won him a scholarship to Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell, where he met fellow student Eleanor Stegeberg. Three years later, they married. All five of their children were born in Mitchell.\n\nMcGovern's political skills came to the fore in college, where he was twice elected class president and won the state oratorical contest on the topic \"My Brother's Keeper,\" which laid out his liberal beliefs.\n\nIn 1942, he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Forces and went on to fly 35 combat missions as a B-24 bomber pilot in Europe. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n\nAfter the war, he returned to college, graduating in 1946. McGovern attended Garrett Seminary for a year before entering Northwestern University in Chicago, where he got his master's and doctoral degrees in American history and government.\n\nHe returned to Dakota Wesleyan University in 1950 as a professor of history and political science, leaving in 1955 to help the South Dakota Democratic Party and launch his political career.\n\nIn 1956, he won a seat in Congress. He was re-elected two years later.\n\nAfter losing a bid for the U.S. Senate in 1960, McGovern was named special assistant to the president and director of the Food for Peace Program by President John F. Kennedy.\n\nTwo years later, he was elected to the Senate. He was re-elected in 1968 and 1974. He served on Senate committees on agriculture, nutrition, forestry and foreign relations, and the Joint Economic Committee. He also served three years on the Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection, which changed the way states picked their delegates, before leaving it in 1971 to run for president.\n\nIn 1972, McGovern was selected as the Democratic Party nominee for president on a platform that included ending the war in Vietnam at a time when the country was torn over U.S. involvement there.\n\n\"Let us resolve that never again will we send the precious young blood of this country to die trying to prop up a corrupt military dictatorship abroad,\" he said, to applause, at the Democratic convention in Miami Beach, Florida.\n\nHe called the unemployment of more than 5 million Americans \"the most false and wasteful economics of all\" and said his highest domestic priority would be \"to ensure that every American able to work has a job to do.\" He called for an end to a system of economic controls \"in which labor is depressed but prices and corporate profits run sky high,\" and he called for national health insurance and \"a fair and just tax system.\"\n\nBut the campaign started out poorly. He selected as running mate Sen. Thomas Eagleton of Missouri, after a background check that did not turn up the fact that Eagleton had been treated for mental illness, which was revealed soon after. Eagleton withdrew and McGovern then tapped Sargent Shriver, a brother-in-law of John F. Kennedy and U.S. ambassador to France.\n\nThe pair ended up losing in a lopsided vote for incumbent Richard Nixon, with the McGovern ticket earning only 17 electoral votes -- from Massachusetts and the District of Columbia -- to Nixon's 520.\n\nMcGovern reflected on that defeat in a September piece in The Washington Post, calling it \"a significant personal setback\" that left him \"genuinely stunned.\"\n\nOpinion: McGovern was ahead of his time\n\n\"The loss is there, an old wound never fully healed. My disappointment was certainly personal, made deeper by the awareness that many thousands of young Americans, and far more Vietnamese and other Asian citizens, were going to and did lose their lives with the Nixon administration's continuation of the war,\" he wrote. \"And I was upset that my supporters would carry the burden of the loss, too -- something that has weighed on me all these years.\"\n\nBut he added, \"I am optimistic about the country, and I am convinced that McGovern for President 1972 helped put those ideals within sight and completion today.\"\n\nSen. John Kerry said Sunday that McGovern never let the political popularity of a subject determine whether he supported a cause.\n\n\"George McGovern was a voice of clarity and conviction at a time when America needed it most,\" Kerry said. \"He spoke to many of us who opposed the war but loved our country, because he was the genuine article, a soft-spoken, decent and gentle man who lived a remarkable life with humility.\"\n\nAfter his presidential loss, McGovern returned to the Senate, where he was re-elected in 1974. But he was beaten when he sought a fourth term in 1980, a victim of what became known as the Reagan Revolution that swept conservatives into power and their views into vogue.\n\nFour years later, he tried again to win the Democratic presidential nomination, but dropped out. Former Vice President Walter Mondale became the nominee -- only to lose to Reagan in another lopsided race.\n\nFormer Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said Sunday that McGovern was more than a very down-to-earth man.\n\n\"George was actually a very complicated person,\" Gingrich said. \"He was not a pacifist. His argument over Vietnam was about that particular war. He was a citizen.\"\n\nAfter leaving the Senate, McGovern taught at a number of schools, including Columbia University, Northwestern University, Cornell University, American University and the University of Berlin. He served as the president of the Middle East Policy Council from 1991 to 1998. President Clinton appointed him ambassador to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome and, in 2000, awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nIn 2001, McGovern was named the first United Nations global ambassador on hunger.\n\nIn the 2008 presidential campaign, McGovern switched his allegiance from Hillary Clinton to Barack Obama. But in a 2009 commentary in the Post, he lashed out at the Obama administration over its policies in Afghanistan and reflected on one of the hallmarks of his political life.\n\n\"As a U.S. senator during the 1960s, I agonized over the badly mistaken war in Vietnam,\" McGovern wrote. \"After doing all I could to save our troops and the Vietnamese people from a senseless conflict, I finally took my case to the public in my presidential campaign in 1972. Speaking across the nation, I told audiences that the only upside of the tragedy in Vietnam was that its enormous cost in lives and dollars would keep any future administration from going down that road again.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family is requesting donations to Feeding South Dakota.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:59:29.477-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:59:29.477-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/21/george-mcgovern-dead-dies_n_1996323.html?icid=hp_front_top_art", "title" : "Former Senator And Presidential Candidate Dies At 90", "text" : "Former U.S. Senator and presidential candidate George McGovern has died, the AP reports.\n\nThe 1972 Democratic Party's nominee for president, he lost to Richard Nixon with only 17 electoral votes.\n\nA longtime progressive, McGovern called for tax reform and a national health insurance. He was also a staunch opponent of the Vietnam War and ran his 1972 presidential campaign on ending it.\n\nMcGovern died on Sunday after entering hospice care last week. His family announced that he was coming to the end of his life after a series of medical problems.\n\nSIOUX FALLS, S.D. — George S. McGovern, a proud liberal who argued fervently against the Vietnam War as a senator from South Dakota and suffered one of the most crushing defeats in presidential election history against Richard Nixon in 1972, died before dawn Sunday. He was 90.\n\nA spokesman for McGovern's family, Steve Hildebrand, told The Associated Press by telephone that McGovern died at 5:15 a.m. Sunday at a hospice in Sioux Falls, surrounded by family and lifelong friends.\n\n\"We are blessed to know that our father lived a long, successful and productive life advocating for the hungry, being a progressive voice for millions and fighting for peace. He continued giving speeches, writing and advising all the way up to and past his 90th birthday, which he celebrated this summer,\" a family statement released by Hildebrand said.\n\nA decorated World War II bomber pilot, McGovern said he learned to hate war by waging it. In his disastrous race against Nixon, he promised to end the conflict in Vietnam and cut defense spending by billions of dollars. He helped create the Food for Peace program and spent much of his career believing the United States should be more accommodating to the former Soviet Union.\n\nNever a showman, he made his case with a style as plain as the prairies where he grew up, often sounding more like the Methodist minister he'd once studied to be than a longtime U.S. senator and three-time candidate for president.\n\nAnd McGovern never shied from the word \"liberal,\" even as other Democrats blanched at the label and Republicans used it as an epithet.\n\n\"I am a liberal and always have been,\" McGovern said in 2001. \"Just not the wild-eyed character the Republicans made me out to be.\"\n\nAmericans voting for president in 1972 were aware of the Watergate break-in, but the most damaging details of Nixon's involvement wouldn't emerge until after Election Day. McGovern tried to make a campaign issue out of the bungled attempt to wiretap the offices of the Democratic National Committee, and he called Nixon the most corrupt president in history, but the issue could not eclipse the embarrassing missteps of his own campaign.\n\nMcGovern was tortured by the selection of Missouri Sen. Thomas F. Eagleton as the vice presidential nominee, and 18 days later, following the disclosure that Eagleton had undergone electroshock therapy for depression, the decision to drop him from the ticket despite having pledged to back him \"1,000 percent.\"\n\nIt was at once the most memorable and the most damaging line of his campaign, and called \"possibly the most single damaging faux pas ever made by a presidential candidate\" by the late political writer Theodore H. White.\n\nAfter a hard day's campaigning – Nixon did virtually none – McGovern would complain to those around him that nobody was paying attention. With R. Sargent Shriver as his running mate, he went on to carry only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia, winning just 38 percent of the popular vote.\n\n\"Tom and I ran into a little snag back in 1972 that in the light of my much advanced wisdom today, I think was vastly exaggerated,\" McGovern said at an event with Eagleton in 2005. Noting that Nixon and his running mate, Spiro Agnew, would both ultimately resign, he joked, \"If we had run in `74 instead of `72, it would have been a piece of cake.\"\n\nMcGovern's campaign, nevertheless, left a lasting imprint on American politics. Determined not to make the same mistake, presidential nominees have since interviewed and intensely investigated their choices for vice president. Former President Bill Clinton got his start in politics when he signed on as a campaign worker for McGovern and is among the legion of Democrats who credit him with inspiring them to public service.\n\n\"I believe no other presidential candidate ever has had such an enduring impact in defeat,\" Clinton said in 2006 at the dedication of McGovern's library in Mitchell, S.D. \"Senator, the fires you lit then still burn in countless hearts.\"\n\nGeorge Stanley McGovern was born on July 19, 1922, in the small farm town of Avon, S.D, the son of a Methodist pastor. He was raised in Mitchell, shy and quiet until he was recruited for the high school debate team and found his niche. He enrolled at Dakota Wesleyan University in his hometown and, already a private pilot, volunteered for the Army Air Force soon after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nThe Army didn't have enough airfields or training planes to take him until 1943. He married his wife, Eleanor Stegeberg, and arrived in Italy the next year. That would be his base for the 35 missions he flew in the B-24 Liberator christened the \"Dakota Queen\" after his new bride.\n\nIn a December 1944 bombing raid on the Czech city of Pilsen, McGovern's plane was hit by anti-aircraft fire that disabled one engine and set fire to another. He nursed the B-24 back to a British airfield on an island in the Adriatic Sea, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross. On his final mission, his plane was hit several times, but he managed to get it back safety – one of the actions for which he received the Air Medal.\n\nMcGovern returned to Mitchell and graduated from Dakota Wesleyan after the war's end, and after a year of divinity school, switched to the study of history and political science at Northwestern University. He earned his masters and doctoral degrees, returned to Dakota Wesleyan to teach history and government, and switched from his family's Republican roots to the Democratic Party.\n\n\"I think it was my study of history that convinced me that the Democratic Party was more on the side of the average American,\" he said.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Democrats held no major offices in South Dakota and only a handful of legislative seats. McGovern, who had gotten into Democratic politics as a campaign volunteer, left teaching in 1953 to become executive secretary of the South Dakota Democratic Party. Three years later, he won an upset election to the House; he served two terms and left to run for Senate.\n\nChallenging conservative Republican Sen. Karl Mundt in 1960, he lost what he called his \"worst campaign.\" He said later that he'd hated Mundt so much that he'd lost his sense of balance.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy named McGovern head of the Food for Peace program, which sends U.S. commodities to deprived areas around the world. He made a second Senate bid in 1962, unseating Sen. Joe Bottum by just 597 votes. He was the first Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate from South Dakota since 1930.\n\nIn his first year in office, McGovern took to the Senate floor to say that the Vietnam War was a trap that would haunt the United States – a speech that drew little notice. He voted the following August in favor of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution under which President Lyndon B. Johnson escalated the U.S. war in the southeast Asian nation.\n\nWhile McGovern continued to vote to pay for the war, he did so while speaking against it. As the war escalated, so did his opposition. Late in 1969, McGovern called for a cease-fire in Vietnam and the withdrawal of all U.S. troops within a year. He later co-sponsored a Senate amendment to cut off appropriations for the war by the end of 1971. It failed, but not before McGovern had taken the floor to declare \"this chamber reeks of blood\" and to demand an end to \"this damnable war.\"\n\nMcGovern first sought the Democratic presidential nomination late in the 1968 campaign, saying he would take up the cause of the assassinated Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. He finished far behind Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, who won the nomination, and Minnesota Sen. Eugene McCarthy, who had led the anti-war challenge to Johnson in the primaries earlier in the year. McGovern later called his bid an \"anti-organization\" effort against the Humphrey steamroller.\n\n\"At least I have precluded the possibility of peaking too early,\" McGovern quipped at the time.\n\nThe following year, McGovern led a Democratic Party reform commission that shifted to voters' power that had been wielded by party leaders and bosses at the national conventions. The result was the system of presidential primary elections and caucuses that now selects the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees.\n\nIn 1972, McGovern ran under the rules he had helped write. Initially considered a longshot against Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of Maine, McGovern built a bottom-up campaign organization and went to the Democratic national convention in command. He was the first candidate to gain a nominating majority in the primaries before the convention.\n\nIt was a meeting filled with intramural wrangling and speeches that verged on filibusters. By the time McGovern delivered his climactic speech accepting the nomination, it was 2:48 a.m., and with most of America asleep, he lost his last and best chance to make his case to a nationwide audience.\n\nMcGovern did not know before selecting Eagleton of his running mate's mental health woes, and after dropping him from the ticket, struggled to find a replacement. Several Democrats said no, and a joke made the rounds that there was a signup sheet in the Senate cloakroom. Shriver, a member of the Kennedy family, finally agreed.\n\nThe campaign limped into the fall on a platform advocating withdrawal from Vietnam in exchange for the release of POWs, cutting defense spending by a third and establishing an income floor for all Americans. McGovern had dropped an early proposal to give every American $1,000 a year, but the Republicans continued to ridicule it as \"the demogrant.\" They painted McGovern as an extreme leftist and Democrats as the party of \"amnesty, abortion and acid.\"\n\nWhile McGovern said little about his decorated service in World War II, Republicans depicted him as a weak peace activist. At one point, McGovern was forced to defend himself against assertions he had shirked combat.\n\nHe'd had enough when a young man at the airport fence in Battle Creek, Mich., taunted that Nixon would clobber him. McGovern leaned in and said quietly: \"I've got a secret for you. Kiss my ass.\" A conservative Senate colleague later told McGovern it was his best line of the campaign.\n\nDefeated by Nixon, McGovern returned to the Senate and pressed there to end the Vietnam war while championing agriculture, anti-hunger and food stamp programs in the United States and food programs abroad. He won re-election to the Senate in 1974, by which point he could make wry jokes about his presidential defeat.\n\n\"For many years, I wanted to run for the presidency in the worst possible way – and last year, I sure did,\" he told a formal press dinner in Washington.\n\nDefeated in his bid for a fourth Senate term in the 1980 Republican landslide that made Ronald Reagan president, McGovern went on to teach and lecture at universities, and found a liberal political action committee. He made a longshot bid in the 1984 presidential race with a call to end U.S. military involvement in Lebanon and Central America and open arms talks with the Soviets. Former Vice President Walter Mondale won the Democratic nomination and went on to lose to President Ronald Reagan by an even bigger margin in electoral votes than had McGovern to Nixon.\n\nHe talked of running a final time for president in 1992, but decided it was time for somebody younger and with fewer political scars.\n\nAfter his career in office ended, McGovern served as U.S. ambassador to the Rome-based United Nation's food agencies from 1998 to 2001 and spent his later years working to feed needy children around the world. He and former Republican Sen. Bob Dole collaborated to create an international food for education and child nutrition program, for which they shared the 2008 World Food Prize.\n\n\"I want to live long enough to see all of the 300 million school-age kids around the world who are not being fed be given a good nutritional lunch every day,\" McGovern said in 2006.\n\nHis opposition to armed conflict remained a constant long after he retired. Shortly before Iowa's caucuses in 2004, McGovern endorsed retired Gen. Wesley Clark, and compared his own opposition to the Vietnam War to Clark's criticism of President George W. Bush's decision to wage war in Iraq. One of the 10 books McGovern wrote was 2006's \"Out of Iraq: A Practical Plan for Withdrawal Now,\" written with William R. Polk.\n\nIn early 2002, George and Eleanor McGovern returned to Mitchell, where they helped raise money for a library bearing their names. Eleanor McGovern died there in 2007 at age 85; they had been married 64 years, and had four daughters and a son.\n\n\"I don't know what kind of president I would have been, but Eleanor would have been a great first lady,\" he said after his wife's death in 2007.\n\nOne of their daughters, Teresa, was found dead in a Madison, Wis., snowdrift in 1994 after battling alcoholism for years. He recounted her struggle in his 1996 book \"Terry,\" and described the writing of it as \"the most painful undertaking in my life.\" It was briefly a best seller and he used the proceeds to help set up a treatment center for victims of alcoholism and mental illness in Madison.\n\nBefore the 2008 presidential campaign, McGovern endorsed Sen. Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination but switched to Barack Obama that May. He called the future president \"a moderate,\" cautious in his ways, who wouldn't waste money or do \"anything reckless.\"\n\n\"I think Barack will emerge as one of our great ones,\" he said in a 2009 interview with The Associated Press. \"It will be a victory for moderate liberalism.\"\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE – Walter R.

He signed up to fight in World War II, and became a decorated bomber pilot over the battlefields of Europe. When the people of South Dakota sent him to Washington, this hero of war became a champion for peace. And after his career in Congress, he became a leading voice in the fight against hunger. George was a statesman of great conscience and conviction, and Michelle and I share our thoughts and prayers with his family.\n\nJill and I are profoundly saddened to hear about George McGovern’s passing. I was honored to serve with him, to know him, and to call him a friend\n\nGeorge believed deeply in public service. It defined him as a Senator and as a man. And he never stopped serving for his entire life – whether it was his courage in World War II, his time in Congress, or his fight to eliminate hunger at home and abroad.\n\nAbove all, George McGovern was a generous, kind, honorable man. He will be missed, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family today.\n\nWe were deeply saddened to learn of the passing of our friend George McGovern. The world has lost a tireless advocate for human rights and dignity.\n\nWe first met George while campaigning for him in 1972. Our friendship endured for 40 years. As a war hero, distinguished professor, Congressman, Senator and Ambassador, George always worked to advance the common good and help others realize their potential. Of all his passions, he was most committed to feeding the hungry, at home and around the world. The programs he created helped feed millions of people, including food stamps in the 1960s and the international school feeding program in the 90's, both of which he co-sponsored with Senator Bob Dole.\n\nIn 2000, Bill had the honor of awarding him the Medal of Freedom. From his earliest days in Mitchell to his final days in Sioux Falls, he never stopped standing up and speaking out for the causes he believed in. We must continue to draw inspiration from his example and build the world he fought for. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends.\n\n \n\n 2004 Democratic Presidential Nominee and U.S. Sen. John Kerry:\n\n\"George McGovern was a voice of clarity and conviction at a time when America needed it most. He spoke to many of us who opposed the war but loved our country, because he was the genuine article, a soft-spoken, decent and gentle man who lived a remarkable life with humility, a decorated bomber pilot who never bragged about his own heroism, even as he ran into the buzzsaw of the negative and destructive politics that marked the Watergate era. He never stopped caring about things like peace, hunger, poverty, and fairness, whether they were in political fashion or not, and history will record, to paraphrase the old saying, that George McGovern may not have been President, but George McGovern was right.\"\n\nFormer New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson on CNN's \"State of the Union\":\n\nHe was a great statesman. I knew him quite well and I'm very saddened. I think he'll be remembers, obviously for his stance on the war in Vietnam, for his bomber missions. But also, for his contributions on agriculture, on hunger.\n\nAnd then the Democratic Party, he transformed the Party, the primary system, getting minorities involved. He was a gigantic figure and a classy god, good guy.\n\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich on CNN's \"State of the Union\":\n\nGeorge actually was a very complicated person. He had served as a bomber pilot in World War II, he was not a pacifist and his argument over Vietnam was about that particular war.\n\nHe was a citizen; I remember being with him at the U.S. Embassy in Rome for dinner one night and talking about he and Goldwater, I mean, he said, one of the nice things about losing badly enough is you don't have lots of regrets about what one thing might you have changed.\n\nAnd he had a very good sense of humor and he was a very down to earth guy who, later on in life, ran a small business, a bed and breakfast and wrote a great article on all the problems we had heaped up on small business through the regulations he had sponsored.\n\nWatch State of the Union with Candy Crowley Sundays at 9am ET.

He was 90 years old.\n\nA family spokesman, Steve Hildebrand, said in a statement that the former senator died at 5:15 a.m. in a hospice in Sioux Falls, S.D.\n\nThe South Dakota liberal had a long career as an influential politician, historian and author. Best known for his strong opposition to the Vietnam War and his staggering loss to Nixon, he also had a distinguished career in public service in the House of Representatives, the Senate and with the United Nations.\n\n“George McGovern dedicated his life to serving the country he loved,” President Barack Obama said in a statement Sunday. “He signed up to fight in World War II, and became a decorated bomber pilot over the battlefields of Europe. When the people of South Dakota sent him to Washington, this hero of war became a champion for peace. And after his career in Congress, he became a leading voice in the fight against hunger. George was a statesman of great conscience and conviction, and Michelle and I share our thoughts and prayers with his family.”\n\nOn the issues, McGovern was a leading liberal Democrat who advocated for fighting world hunger, protecting farmers and ending the war in Vietnam.\n\nBorn in the small town of Avon, S.D. , on July 19, 1922, McGovern and his family moved to Mitchell, S.D. , in 1928. McGovern’s father was a Wesleyan Methodist reverend and both his parents were staunch Republicans. McGovern thrived on his high school debate team and went on to enroll at Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell in 1940.\n\nIn college, McGovern was a popular student who was elected class president twice. He learned to fly then, as well, serving as a member of the government’s Civilian Pilot Training Program and getting his pilot’s license. McGovern later told the publication Airport Journals that “frankly, I was scared to death on that first solo flight. But when I walked away from it, I had an enormous feeling of satisfaction that I had taken the thing off the ground and landed it without tearing the wings off.”\n\nDuring his university years, he also fell in love with Eleanor Stegeberg — who McGovern had first met when she and her twin sister beat him during a high school debate — and the couple married in 1943 after McGovern was called up for service in WWII.\n\nMcGovern flew 35 combat missions as a B-24 bomber pilot in Europe and earned the Distinguished Flying Cross. He was posted to the 741st Squadron, 455th Bomb Group at San Giovanni Field in Italy in September 1944 and tasked with bombing oil refineries and other strategic locations throughout Europe. His plane was dubbed the Dakota Queen after his wife, and his first daughter, Ann, was born while he was serving in the war. McGovern was discharged in July 1945 with the rank of First Lieutenant.\n\nThe young pilot had resolved during his time fighting abroad to become a history professor on his return to the U.S., and he graduated from Dakota Wesleyan in 1946. McGovern then studied at Garrett Theological Seminary for a year before enrolling in Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., for his post-graduate history degrees.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:59:33.148-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:59:33.148-0400" } } ] },{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5414e8872c243f6497703650" }, "title" : "Obama, Romney battle over foreign policy in final U.S. presidential debate", "articles" : [ { "ext_url" : "http://www.channel4.com/news/obama-on-the-attack-in-final-presidential-debate", "title" : "Obama on the attack in final presidential debate", "text" : "The incumbent president said the former Massachusetts governor had been \"all over the map\" in his positions on major foreign policy issues.\n\n\"Every time you have offered an opinion you have been wrong,\" he said.\n\n\"You said we should have gone into Iraq, despite the fact there were no weapons of mass destruction.

Maroon and white Qatari flags decorate lampposts and there are huge billboards bearing his face. At Gaza's Rafah crossing after arriving from Egypt in a vast motorcade, the emir was met by the Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniya and given a red carpet reception. No head of state has made such a journey since Hamas came to power - and the Islamist movement wants to make political capital. Qatar has now pledged $400m for construction projects here. Hamas says for the first time Egypt will allow the building materials for the developments to be brought in overland, bypassing the Strip's smuggling tunnels which have flourished under an Israeli and Egyptian blockade. Since Hamas's fallout with the Syrian leadership, Qatar has become one of the movement's main benefactors. But Qatar is also one of America's key Arab allies. That has led some in Gaza to accuse the Gulf State of meddling in Palestinian politics.\n\n\"Your visit today officially announces the break of the economic blockade and political blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip by the forces of injustice,\" said the Hamas prime minister.\n\nFor his part, the emir of Qatar used the landmark visit to call for warring Palestinian factions to unite.\n\n\"Why are you staying divided?\" he asked an audience at Gaza's Islamic University. \"There are no peace negotiations, and there is no clear strategy of resistance and liberation. Why shouldn't brothers sit together and reconcile?\"\n\nHamas, which won parliamentary elections in 2006, ousted forces loyal to Palestinian Authority President Abbas in Gaza during clashes in 2007 and set up a rival government.\n\nIn response, Israel tightened its blockade on the coastal territory, which has had a crippling effect on Gaza's economy.\n\nThe emir's speech had been scheduled to take place at a major rally in Gaza City's 40,000-seat football stadium, but that event was called off at the last minute amid reports the stadium was sparsely filled.\n\nHamas officials said the sheikh's busy schedule was responsible for the cancellation: During his four-hour visit, the emir launched housing and hospital projects and received an honorary degree.\n\nIsraeli officials seemed bemused by the visit.\n\n\"This is more than strange, especially since Hamas is internationally recognized as a terror group,\" said Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman, Yigal Palmor.\n\n\"By hugging Hamas publicly, the emir of Qatar has thrown peace under the bus.\"\n\nQatar, one of the richest countries in the Arab world, has become an important source of revenue for Hamas in the aftermath of its fallout with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nIn February, Hamas announced that its political leadership had been moved from Syria to Egypt and Qatar, because it could no longer effectively operate amid the unrest in Syria.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:59:51.768-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T20:59:51.768-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://blogs.channel4.com/lindsey-hilsum-on-international-affairs/why-qatar-is-opening-its-cheque-book-in-gaza/931", "title" : "Why Qatar is opening its cheque book in Gaza", "text" : "Why Qatar is opening its cheque book in Gaza\n\nSo small and yet so rich.\n\nThe tiny gas-rich Gulf state of Qatar boasts the highest per capita wealth in the world, and Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa al-Thani has international ambitions to match.\n\n\n\nHe founded the international TV network Al Jazeera. His government has hosted talks with the Taliban, brokered deals in Lebanon and provided weapons to rebels in Libya and Syria. Qatar also manages to be a close ally of the US, hosting an American airbase, at the same time as maintaining close links with Islamist scholars and politicians.\n\nToday he has become the first Arab head of state to visit Gaza since Israel occupied the strip in 1967. He was mobbed by enthusiastic crowds because for the Gazans, this is a major breakthrough. Since the Islamist group Hamas was elected in 2006, their government has been shunned by the world and blockaded by the Israelis. Israel bombed Gaza in 2008, destroying much of the infrastructure. Sheikh Hamad has come with £250m worth of construction projects, which will help rebuild the territory and also provide jobs.\n\nThe visit also has symbolic meaning. Hamas is an off-shoot of the Muslim Brotherhood in neighbouring Egypt. It was therefore unpopular with Egypt’s former rulers, which had signed a peace accord with Israel and suppressed the Brotherhood. After last year’s Arab Spring revolution, and the election of a Muslim Brotherhood President, relations between Gaza and Egypt have warmed and the border is no longer permanently closed.\n\nInstead of looking to Damascus and Tehran, Hamas is looking to Cairo and the Gulf. The Islamist movement closed its offices in Syria, and cooled relations with Iran. They said that was because of the cruel behaviour of the Syrian government towards its own people, but it was also because of a major realignment in the region.\n\nGazans are Sunni Muslims. They have more in common religiously as well as ideologically with Egypt and the Gulf states than with Shia (and Persian) Iran or the Alawite-led government of Syria. They only looked there for support before because no-one else would help them.\n\nThe Israeli government likes the idea of Gaza getting closer to Egypt — they would prefer that the strip was absorbed into some great amorphous Arab land. But they are deeply worried that these power-shifts are beyond their control. They used to play off one Arab leader against another. Now the region is re-ordering itself — for better or worse — without Israeli intervention.\n\nThe Gulf has been important twice in its history – first when Mohammed founded Islam, and secondly when they found oil. Its importance could easily wane, as western countries become less dependent on the Middle East for energy.\n\nQatar wants to be the essential nation in a changing world, the place both western and Arab nations go for mediation, support, brokering deals and peace talks.

Stern School of Business. “It’s the most accepted data.” Still, he adds, “The numbers must be taken with a grain of salt.” That’s because there are a host of issues that can make any GDP comparisons misleading, including how the quality of goods varies from country to country, he explains.\n\n“Also, in some countries, the wealth is equally distributed, while in others it’s very unequally distributed,” Clementi says. “In Qatar, for example, the way it’s distributed is very unequal, and much of the population is actually very poor. The GDP is high because of oil revenues. And, if I were to use the GDP as an indicator of how well a country will do in the future, in Qatar what will matter is how well they actually invest it.”\n\nLike Qatar, many of the countries in the top 15 spots on our list rely on natural resources to fill their coffers. In Norway, which ranks fourth, petroleum accounts for nearly half of exports and is the main contributor to its PPP-adjusted GDP per capita of nearly $52,000; the country is also one of the world’s largest gas exporters. Brunei, meanwhile, located on the island of Borneo, reaps the benefits of extensive petroleum and natural gas fields and comes in at No. 5 with a PPP-adjusted per capita GDP of just over $48,000. And the United Arab Emirates looks to its oil and gas for about 25% of its GDP, which is nearly $47,500 per capita (PPP).\n\nOther well-heeled countries benefiting at least in part from natural resources are Australia, ranking at No. 11; Canada, at No. 14; and Kuwait, at No. 15, which relies on its crude oil reserves for at least half of GDP, and almost all of its export revenues and government income.\n\nSo which countries are poorest?

If so, share your images and footage with CNN iReport, but please stay safe.\n\n(CNN) -- Though no longer a hurricane, \"post-tropical\" superstorm Sandy packed a hurricane-sized punch as it slammed into the Jersey Shore on Monday, killing at least 11 people from West Virginia to North Carolina and Connecticut.\n\nSandy whipped torrents of water over the streets of Atlantic City, stretching for blocks inland and ripping up part of the vacation spot's fabled boardwalk. The storm surge set records in Lower Manhattan, where flooded substations caused a widespread power outage. It swamped beachfronts on both sides of Long Island Sound and delivered hurricane-force winds from Virginia to Cape Cod as it came ashore.\n\nSandy's wrath also prompted the evacuation of about 200 patients at NYU Langone Medical Center.\n\n\"We are having intermittent telephone access issues, and for this reason the receiving hospital will notify the families of their arrival,\" spokeswoman Lisa Greiner said.\n\nIn addition, the basement of New York's Bellevue Hospital Center flooded, and the hospital was running off of emergency backup power. Ian Michaels of the Office of Emergency Management said the main priority is to help secure additional power and obtain additional fuel and pumps for the hospital.\n\nThe storm hit near Atlantic City about 8 p.m. ET, the National Hurricane Center reported. It packed 80-mph winds at landfall, down from the 90 mph clocked earlier Monday.\n\n\"I've been down here for about 16 years, and it's shocking what I'm looking at now. It's unbelievable,\" said Montgomery Dahm, owner of the Tun Tavern in Atlantic City, which stayed open as Sandy neared the Jersey Shore. \"I mean, there's cars that are just completely underwater in some of the places I would never believe that there would be water.\"\n\nDahm's family cleared out of Atlantic City before the storm hit, but he says he stayed put to serve emergency personnel. At nightfall Monday, he said the water was lapping at the steps of his restaurant, where a generator was keeping the lights on.\n\nThe storm had already knocked down power lines and tree limbs while still 50 miles offshore and washed out a section of the boardwalk on the north end of town, Atlantic City Mayor Lorenzo Langford told CNN. He said there were still \"too many people\" who didn't heed instructions to evacuate, and he urged anyone still in town to \"hunker down and try to wait this thing out.\"\n\n\"When Mother Nature sends her wrath your way, we're at her mercy, and so all we can do is stay prayerful and do the best that we can,\" Langford said.\n\nAnd in Seaside Heights, about 30 miles north of Atlantic City, Police Chief Thomas Boyd told CNN, \"The whole north side of my town is totally under water.\"\n\nIn New York, lower Manhattan's Battery Park recorded nearly 14-foot tide, smashing a record set by 1960's Hurricane Donna by more than 3 feet. The city had already halted service on its bus and train lines, closing schools and ordering about 400,000 people out of their homes in low-lying areas of Manhattan and elsewhere.\n\nFlooding forced the closure of all three of the major airports in the area, LaGuardia, John F. Kennedy and Newark Liberty. Water seeped into subway stations in Lower Manhattan and into the tunnel connecting Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, while high winds damaged a crane perched atop a Midtown skyscraper under construction, forcing authorities to evacuate the surrounding area.\n\nNew York Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters there was an \"extraordinary\" amount of water in Lower Manhattan, as well as downed trees throughout the city and widespread power outages.\n\n\"We knew that this was going to be a very dangerous storm, and the storm has met our expectations,\" he said. \"The worst of the weather has come, and city certainly is feeling the impacts.\"\n\nThe storm was blamed for more than 2.8 million outages across the Northeast. About 350,000 of them were in the New York city area, where utility provider Con Edison reported it had also cut power to customers in parts of Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan to protect underground equipment as the storm waters rose.\n\nBut as water crept into its substations, Con Ed said it had lost service to about 250,000 customers in Manhattan -- including most of the island south of 39th Street.\n\nFive things to know about Sandy\n\nAt least five people had been killed in storm-related incidents in New York state, including three killed by trees falling on homes in Queens and in the town of New Salem, near Albany, city and state officials said. Falling trees were also blamed for three deaths reported in New Jersey and one in Connecticut, authorities there told CNN.\n\nIn West Virginia, a woman was killed in a car accident after the storm dumped 5 inches of snow on the town of Davis, said Amy Shuler Goodwin, a spokeswoman for Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin's office.\n\nAnd before hitting land, it overwhelmed the sailing ship HMS Bounty, a replica of the historic British vessel, off North Carolina. Fourteen of the ship's crew of 16 were rescued, but the body of one deckhand was found Monday evening and the ship's captain was still missing Monday night, the Coast Guard said.\n\nSandy had already claimed at least 67 lives in the Caribbean, including 51 in Haiti.\n\nSandy's storm surges were boosted by a full moon, which already brings the highest tides of the month. And forecasters said the storm was likely to collide with a cold front and spawn a superstorm that could generate flash floods and snowstorms.\n\n\"It could be bad,\" said U.S. Coast Guard Rear Adm. Steven Rattior, \"or it could be devastation.\"\n\nMass transit shut down across the densely populated Northeast, landmarks stood empty and schools and government offices were closed. The National Grid, which provides power to millions of customers, said 60 million people could be affected before it's over.\n\nOn Fire Island, off Long Island, the water rose above promenades and docks on Monday afternoon, homeowner Karen Boss said. Boss stayed on the island with her husband despite a mandatory evacuation order. She said they own several properties and a business there and had weathered previous storms.\n\n\"I'm concerned that it might come into the first floor,\" she said. \"If that's the case, I'll just move into another house that's higher up.\"\n\nBased on pressure readings, it's likely to be the strongest storm to make landfall north of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, CNN senior meteorologist Dave Hennen said. The benchmark storm, the 1938 \"Long Island Express\" Hurricane, contained a low pressure reading of 946 millibars; Sandy had a minimum pressure of 943 millibars. Generally speaking, the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm.\n\nIn Sea Bright, New Jersey, Yvette Cafaro scrawled a plea on the plywood that covered her burger restaurant: \"Be kind to us Sandy.\" The seaside area largely dodged last year's Hurricane Irene, but Cafaro was not optimistic that Sea Bright would be spared Sandy.\n\n\"Everything that we've been watching on the news looks like this one will really get us,\" she said. \"We're definitely worried about it.\"\n\nIts arrival, eight days before the U.S. presidential election, forced President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, to alter or cancel several campaign stops. Obama flew back to Washington from Florida, telling reporters at the White House that assets were in place for an effective response to the storm.\n\n\"The most important message I have for the public right now is please listen to what your state and local officials are saying,\" Obama said. \"When they tell you to evacuate, you need to evacuate.\"\n\nAnd in Ohio, Romney asked supporters to drop off items and cash at his \"victory centers\" to be donated to victims of the storm.\n\n\"There are families in harm's way that will be hurt -- either in their possessions or perhaps in something more severe,\" Romney said.\n\nBy Monday afternoon, 23 states were under a warning or advisory for wind related to Sandy. Thousands of flights had been canceled, and hundreds of roads and highways were expected to flood. And according to a government model, Sandy's wind damage alone could cause more than $7 billion in economic loss.\n\nSandy was expected to weaken once it moves inland, but the center was expected to move slowly northward, meaning gusty winds and heavy rain would continue through Wednesday.\n\nOn the western side of the storm, the mountains of West Virginia expected up to 3 feet of snow and the mountains of southwestern Virginia to the Kentucky state line could see up to 2 feet. Twelve to 18 inches of snow were expected in the mountains near the North Carolina-Tennessee border.\n\n\"This is not a typical storm,\" said Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett. \"Essentially, this is a hurricane wrapped in a 'nor'easter.'\"\n\nCNN's Elizabeth Cohen, Dana Ford, Tom Watkins, Josh Levs, Chelsea J.

He urged people not in low-lying areas to stay at home.\n\nAir travel has been badly hit, with some 5,000 flights cancelled.\n\nAir France cancelled all flights into New York and Washington DC on Monday, while British Airways cancelled all Monday's flights to and from cities along the eastern seaboard, including New York, Baltimore, Washington, Boston and Philadelphia, with the exception of BA238 from Boston.\n\nVirgin Atlantic cancelled Monday's flights to and from New York's JFK airport, Newark, Boston and Washington.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange said its trading floor would be closed on Monday, but electronic transactions would still be possible.\n\nSimilar precautions were taken last year as Hurricane Irene approached the East Coast. It killed more than 40 people from North Carolina to Maine and caused an estimated $10bn (£6bn) worth of damage.\n\nFema director Craig Fugate said: \"This is not a coastal threat alone. This is a very large area.\"\n\nIts safety tips include preparations for and what to do during and after a hurricane.\n\nWhile the East Coast is used to extreme weather, Sandy is causing concern to meteorologists who fear it could mutate into a \"Frankenstorm\" as it merges with a winter storm in the run-up to Halloween.\n\nIt is only moving north-east at 15mph, and could hit as many as 12 states, bringing up to 25cm of rain, 60cm of snow, extreme storm surges and power cuts.\n\nStates of emergency have been declared in Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington DC and a coastal county in North Carolina.\n\nThe NHC said further strengthening was possible on Sunday, before Sandy touched down anywhere between Virginia and southern New England late on Monday.\n\nIn New Jersey, Governor Chris Christie pleaded with residents not to be complacent.\n\n\"I know everyone's saying this isn't going to happen… that the weathermen always get it wrong,\" he said.\n\nHe urged people to stock up on essentials in case they were trapped at home for a few days.\n\n\"We have to be prepared for the worst here.

Officials said the hurricane system has cost at least 58 lives in addition to destroying or badly damaging thousands of homes.\n\nWhile Jamaica, Cuba and the Bahamas took direct hits from the storm, the majority of deaths and most extensive damage was in impoverished Haiti, where it has rained almost non-stop since Tuesday.\n\nThe official death toll in Haiti stood at 44 Saturday, but authorities said that could still rise. The country's ramshackle housing and denuded hillsides are especially vulnerable to flooding when rains come.\n\n\"This is a disaster of major proportions,\" Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe told The Associated Press. \"The whole south is under water.\"\n\nHe said the death toll jumped on Saturday because it was the first day that authorities were able to go out and assess the damage, which he estimated was in the hundreds of millions of dollars, the bulk of it in lost crops.\n\nNineteen people are reported injured and another 12 are missing, according to Haiti's Civil Protection Office.\n\nOne of the remaining threats was a still-rising muddy river in the northern part of the capital, Port-au-Prince.\n\n\"If the river busts its banks, it's going to create a lot of problems.

Nearly 17,800 people had to move to 131 temporary shelters, the Civil Protection Office said.\n\nAmong those hoping for a dry place to stay was 35-year-old Iliodor Derisma in Port-au-Prince, who said the storm had caused a lot of anguish.\n\n\"It's wet all my clothes, and all the children aren't living well,\" he said. \"We're hungry.

He said the city was hit by heavy rains but that no major damage was reported.\n\n\"Water came into the houses, water got on the beds, but they didn't lose their homes,\" he said. \"Leogane was underwater mostly, but now we have less water.\"\n\nPresident Michel Martelly and Lamothe handed out water bottles to dozens of people in a Port-au-Prince neighborhood on Friday. They also distributed money to local officials to help clean up the damage.\n\nSandy left dozens of families homeless when it barreled across Jamaica Wednesday as a Category 1 hurricane. One man was crushed to death by a boulder that tumbled into his house. Military officials on Saturday were carrying supplies and doctors to five communities in the southern mountainous region that had been cut off by floods.\n\nThe storm hit eastern Cuba as a Category 2 hurricane early Thursday. Eleven people died in Santiago and Guantanamo provinces and official news media said the storm caused 5,000 houses to at least partially collapse while 30,000 others lost roofs. Banana, coffee, bean and sugar crops were damaged.\n\nThe storm then churned into the Bahamas archipelago, toppling light posts, flooding roads and ripping down tree branches. Police said the British CEO of an investment bank died when he fell from his roof in upscale Lyford Cay late Thursday while trying to repair a window shutter. Officials at Deltec Bank & Trust identified him as Timothy Fraser-Smith, who became CEO in 2000.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, police said a man in his 50s died Friday in the southern town of Juana Diaz, swept away in a river swollen by rain from Sandy's outer bands. Flooding forced at least 100 families in southwestern Puerto Rico to seek shelter.\n\nAuthorities in the Dominican Republic evacuated more than 18,100 people after the storm destroyed several bridges and isolated at least 130 communities.

At least 55,000 people had been evacuated ahead of Sandy, Cuban officials said, principally because of expected flooding. The US National Hurricane Centre (NHC) said at 09:00 GMT on Thursday morning that Sandy, with maximum sustained winds of more than 160kph, was preparing to move off Cuba's northeastern coast. The eye of the storm came ashore just west of the city, with waves up to nine metres and a two metre storm surge that caused extensive coastal flooding, Jose Rubiera of the Cuban weather service said in a television report. Earlier, Sandy struck the Caribbean island of Jamaica, where it toppled power lines and forced more than a thousand people to flee their homes. Meteorologists at the NHC said the storm was causing winds of up to 175km per hour (kph) and had become a \"strong\" category two hurricane by Thursday morning. Citing police, meanwhile, local media in Jamaica reported that Sandy had claimed its first victim on Wednesday, killing a 74-year-old man who was crushed when a boulder rolled onto a house in Eastern St Andrew. Schools and businesses were closed and authorities moved residents in low-lying, flood-prone areas into shelters as steady rain and winds pounded Jamaica. \"A part of the roof of my veranda just went like that,\" said Walford Freak, 55, who lives in the coastal city of Iter Boreale. \"At least five of my neighbours have lost their entire roofs.\" The country's electricity provider meanwhile said about 70 per cent of its customers were without power due to the high winds and torrential rain. \"This is a very serious storm,\" Portia Simpson-Miller, the Jamaican prime minister, said earlier, after cutting short a visit to Canada and rushing home before the island's international airports closed. \"The government takes the threat seriously and I call on all Jamaicans to do likewise and prepare to face the enormous risks that this type of weather system can bring.\" Police ordered a 48-hour curfew in major towns for safety and to deter looters, while slum dwellers in Kingston's sprawling shantytowns hunkered down as the storm moved north across the island. The Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management said more than 1,064 people had moved into emergency shelters across the country, according to Jamaican daily The Gleaner. The eye of the storm made landfall eight kilometres south of Kingston, which is home to one million of the island nation's 2.7 million inhabitants, at 3:00pm local time (19:00 GMT) on Wednesday. At the time, the storm was causing winds of up to 129kph. As the storm powered towards southeastern Cuba, it rapidly strengthened. The sustained winds were measured at 175kph, implying that Sandy was a strong category two hurricane. Sandy was forecast to dump up to 12 inches of rain across Jamaica, eastern Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic - with some isolated areas seeing totals as high as 20 inches. \"These rains may produce life-threatening flash floods and mudslides, especially in areas of mountainous terrain,\" the Miami-based NHC said. On the forecast track, Sandy will move over portions of eastern Cuba overnight before heading to the Bahamas on Thursday and Friday. Tropical storm conditions were also forecast for Florida's east coast. Michael Brennan, a hurricane forecaster at the NHC in Miami, said the storm's wind field was likely to extend 322km west from the center as it passed over the Bahamas, causing \"very high surf and dangerous conditions all the way up the east coast into the [US states of North and South] Carolina\". Forecasters are not sure where it would go after that, with some computer models showing it could pose a risk to the US northeast early next week. \"It's too early to tell but there are some signs that have it hooking back towards the mainland as a wintertime 'nor-easter,'\" said Brennan, referring to the powerful stormsthat can form in the north Atlantic at this time of year. As heavy rain doused Cuba, some 1,700 people were evacuated in the country's Santiago de Cuba province as a precautionary measure. \"We cannot put a single human life in danger. We must evacuate people in areas we know are likely to be flooded, without losing time,\" Lazaro Esposito, a local civil defence official, told Cuban television. The hurricane has also brought rough weather to the US naval base at Guantanamo where the US holds terrorims suspects. The Pentagon said a preliminary hearing at Guantanamo involving the alleged al-Qaeda mastermind of the USS Cole bombing in 2000 was delayed until Thursday due to the storm. In 2008, Cuba was hit by three hurricanes that caused a total of $10bn in damage and affected more than half a million homes. Tropical Storm Gustav, which was less powerful than Hurricane Sandy, with sustained winds of 112km per hour, killed seven people in Jamaica in 2008.

The BBC has repeatedly denied such claims.\n\nBBC director general George Entwistle said he was launching the inquiry to shake off the \"clouds of suspicion\".\n\nOutlining terms of reference on Thursday, a statement on behalf of the review said: \"It will establish whether there were any failings in the BBC management of the Newsnight investigation relating to allegations of sexual abuse of children by Jimmy Savile, including the broadcast of tribute programmes on the BBC.\n\n\"This will encompass the BBC's handling of material derived from the investigation that could have been of interest to the police or relevant authorities and whether any inappropriate managerial pressure or consideration may have influenced the decision of the editor of Newsnight.\"\n\nIt said the review will examine the editorial decision on the Newsnight investigation and a blog dated 2 October posted by the programme's editor which was changed by the BBC on 22 October 2012.\n\nIn the original blog, Newsnight editor Peter Rippon explained the editorial reasons behind his decision to axe the report.

He was released on bail.\n\nBBC Director General George Entwistle and his predecessor Mark Thompson, incoming Chief Executive Officer of the New York Times Co, have come under heavy criticism for their handling of suspicions about Savile.\n\nAt a recent parliamentary hearing Entwistle rejected claims that BBC bosses tried to hide allegations against Savile or suppressed an inquiry by one of their own news programmes.\n\nThompson, who was still director general in late 2011 when BBC's Newsnight shelved a report investigating the allegations against Savile, has said he did not know about the programme's investigation and had no involvement in the decision to axe the report.\n\nThe scandal has attracted attention in the United States, where Thompson's appointment at the New York Times has been questioned by senior journalists at the newspaper, who have accused him of involvement in a cover-up to protect his former employer's reputation.\n\nThompson has said he had approached his new employers to explain his role at the BBC and why he had not dealt with such an issue, despite being the director general and editor-in-chief of the world-renowned organisation.\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron has said the sex abuse allegations leave the BBC and other institutions with serious questions to answer.\n\nThe revelations have shocked fans of the once highly popular Savile, who died last year at the age of 84, as one of Britain's most prolific sex offenders.\n\nIn a sign of preparation for claims, his 4.3 million pound estate has been frozen in response to the allegations.\n\nPolice working on the investigation are following three broad lines of inquiry: alleged offences by Savile, by others, and by Savile and others acting together.\n\nStarr, 69, has publicly denied one allegation linked to a show Savile presented in the 1970s.\n\n\"The individual falls under the strand of the investigation we have termed 'Savile and others',\" the police said.\n\n\"I'm being persecuted by the press saying that I have been with underage girls and I haven't - never will I go with underage girls,\" Starr told the BBC last month.\n\n\"I'm totally innocent.

But sources close to Mark Thompson said the former director general, who ran the BBC at the time, had not yet been asked.\n\nRippon says that he decided to drop the Savile investigation last December for \"editorial reasons\". Last week Entwistle told MPs that Helen Boaden had told the Newsnight editor at the time that any investigation into the late presenter needed to weigh the evidence against Savile as if he was still alive. Newsnight journalists say that effectively amounted to \"a kill order,\" because the evidence from the women who were abused as girls would not have stood up in a libel case.\n\nThere had been complaints that Pollard, a former head of Sky News, had been slow in getting his independent inquiry moving but several BBC insiders say that has changed dramatically this week, with his team actively demanding information.\n\nIt is also understood that the Pollard inquiry's terms of reference have also been widened to encompass the blog Rippon published early last month. That blog has since been corrected several times, and Rippon as a result was asked to step aside from his role at the beginning of last week.\n\nNewsnight journalists complained about the accuracy of Rippon's blog to four different BBC executives over the past month, including David Jordan, the head of editorial policy, Stephen Mitchell, the deputy head of BBC News, and Ken Macquarrie, the head of BBC Scotland. It was only when the complaints were heard by Peter Horrocks, the head of the BBC World Service, that any action took place – with sources saying Horrocks told Lord Patten, the BBC Trust chairman, that the blog needed to be corrected.\n\nThe idea behind the face-to-face hearings in front of Pollard is to give those involved in the row a chance to make a personal statement, although if necessary individuals could be asked to give a second interview towards the end of next week, or in the first part of the following week – if aspects of their account need to be interrogated further.\n\nIt is not clear exactly when Pollard will compete his work, but BBC insiders believe that the earliest he is likely to finish his job is at the end of November. He will report to the BBC's executive board, from which Entwistle and Boaden will be excluded, and which will be chaired by Dame Fiona Reynolds.\n\n• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

Over the weekend the walls and windows of Savile's cottage in Glencoe, where he once entertained Prince Charles to a private supper, were daubed with \"abusive slogans\" according to a spokesman for the Northern Constabulary. \"Jimmy the beast\" and \"Worst beast\" were painted in black half-a-metre high letters on the side of the building in the Highlands, which was searched last week by police looking for \"evidence of any others being involved in any offending with him\".\n\nGlitter, 68, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was filmed leaving his home on Sunday morning, wearing a hat, sunglasses, dark coat and gloves. He was driven away in an unmarked people carrier without commenting.\n\nHe has previously denied allegations he was involved in child sex abuse with Savile. He was drawn into the scandal after Karin Ward, a former pupil at Duncroft approved school for girls in Surrey, told the BBC last year that she had seen Glitter having sex with a schoolgirl in Savile's BBC dressing room while Savile and several other people were there.\n\nGlitter is a convicted paedophile. He was jailed for four months in the UK in 1999 for downloading child porn, and in 2006 for child sex offences in Vietnam where he served two-and-a-half years in prison. Glitter always maintained he was innocent of the charges.\n\nThe corporation cancelled plans to broadcast a Newsnight expose of Savile's sex crimes last year, which included testimony from Ward. Lord Patten, chairman of the BBC Trust, has apologised unreservedly to the abused women who spoke to Newsnight but did not have their stories told. He said there would be \"no covering our backs\" in the BBC's investigation of the abuse scandal.\n\n\"Can it really be the case that no one knew what he was doing?\" he asked in an article for the Mail on Sunday. \"Did some turn a blind eye to criminality? Did some prefer not to follow up their suspicions because of this criminal's popularity and place in the schedules? Were reports of criminality put aside or buried? Even those of us who were not there at the time are inheritors of the shame.\"\n\nThe editor of Newsnight, Peter Rippon, has already stood aside and on Sunday it was claimed that the BBC's former director general, Mark Thompson, must have known about sex abuse allegations against Savile because they were raised with his office by journalists earlier this year.\n\nIn May the BBC was asked by the Sunday Times, under the Freedom of Information Act, to reveal what it knew about exchanges between BBC bosses – including Thompson – about Savile and the Newsnight investigation as well as any contact the BBC had with police over claims that Savile \"sexually molested minors on BBC premises in the 1970s\". When it refused to answer, a reporter called Thompson's office and asked to speak to him about the claims.\n\nThompson has repeatedly denied having any personal knowledge of the allegations. A spokesman for Thompson, who takes over as chief executive of the New York Times next month, said he was on holiday at the time and \"this brief conversation was not relayed to him, either then or subsequently\".\n\nIn September, ITV separately emailed the BBC with detailed questions about the findings of its own investigation based on interviews with 10 victims. The broadcaster confirmed the note was forwarded to Thompson's office, but a spokesman for Thompson said the former director general does \"not recall being briefed and took no part in the response to the email\".\n\nLast week police revealed that they were investigating three former BBC bosses from a 1980s TV programme after some of the 130 victims they have interviewed claimed the men were in league with Savile. The publicist Max Clifford said on Saturday that up to 15 celebrities had approached him, fearful that their sexual exploits in the 1960s and 1970s might lead to them being caught up in the police inquiry.\n\nOn Sunday evening, Savile's great-niece told Sky News she believed some members of his family knew of what they called his \"dark side\" but that they turned a blind eye to it. Caroline Robinson, 49, said she was sexually abused twice by Savile: at a family gathering when she was 12, and again at an engagement party when she was 15.\n\n\"It was not as though I was on my own. There were members of the family there as well,\" she said. \"Jimmy got it down to perfection, where he managed to do it … and nobody noticed.\n\n\"After it happened when I was 12, I spoke to my grandmother. I told her what Jimmy had done. Her reply was: 'It's only Jimmy, it doesn't matter, I'll sort it out'.

He received endorsements from Colin L. Powell, the former secretary of state, and Michael R. Bloomberg, the independent mayor of New York City. And on Wednesday, the president stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Chris Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, as the two toured the state’s devastated coastal communities.\n\nBut Mr. Romney’s withering, yearlong critique of the president’s economic stewardship has brought him to a virtual tie in national surveys. His campaign hopes that continued attacks combined with a renewed, bipartisan appeal to moderate and independent voters will help him overcome the president’s state-by-state organization.\n\nAfter spending close to $1 billion each, the two candidates are finishing the campaign where polls show they are strongest: with Mr. Obama stressing his pledge to protect the middle class and Mr. Romney promising to fix the nation’s economy. Mr. Romney’s campaign also signaled its intention to battle Mr. Obama on more fronts, with the campaign announcing on Thursday that he will make a stop in Pennsylvania on Sunday, an indication that Republican strategists believe they might be able to win a state that has been trending Democratic.\n\nBoth sides are bracing for Friday morning’s release of the October unemployment rate, a final piece of economic evidence that could either bolster Mr. Romney’s accusations of fiscal malpractice or provide further ammunition for the president’s case that the country’s struggling economy is finally headed in the right direction and creating jobs.\n\nAfter avoiding attacks on Mr. Obama for 72 hours because of the storm, Mr. Romney plunged back into the fray in Roanoke, Va., mocking the president for proposing a cabinet-level post devoted to business development. Mr. Obama discussed the idea in an interview with MSNBC that was shown Monday, just as Mr. Romney was entering cease-fire mode.\n\n“I don’t think adding a new chair in his cabinet will help add millions of jobs on Main Street,” Mr. Romney told an enthusiastic crowd Thursday morning at a family-owned factory. “We need a president who understands business, and I do.”\n\nThe campaign unveiled a new ad echoing those remarks and saying that the president’s “answer to everything” was simply adding another government bureaucrat. But at his rally, Mr. Romney also played down his own record as a businessman, focusing instead on how he would govern with the support of Democrats and independents should he win on Tuesday.\n\n“We know something about the past, we’ve seen what his policies have produced,” Mr. Romney said in Virginia. “The only way to get this economy going is the kind of bold change I’ve described, real change from Day 1.”\n\nMr. Romney’s efforts to claim the mantle of change from Mr. Obama — who rode to victory in 2008 by promising a new kind of politics — drew sharp criticism from the president as he began the first of three rallies in three states on Thursday. Wearing a black Air Force One bomber jacket at a rally in Wisconsin, the president scoffed at Mr. Romney’s offer of a new direction.\n\n“Let me tell you, Wisconsin,” Mr. Obama said. “We know what change looks like. And what the governor is offering sure ain’t change.”\n\nAt a sun-drenched rally in Las Vegas, Mr. Obama appeared at once sobered and galvanized by his tour of the devastation in New Jersey, drawing on the experience to frame his pitch for bipartisan cooperation and a robust government role in society.\n\n“It reminds us that when disaster strikes, we see America at its best,” Mr. Obama said. “All the petty differences that consume us in normal times somehow melt away. There are no Democrats or Republicans in a storm — just fellow Americans.”", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:00:22.379-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:00:22.379-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/us-election/9648613/US-Election-live.html", "title" : "US Election: November 1 as it happened", "text" : "Follow our US Election coverage as Mitt Romney and Barack Obama fight it out to become President.\n\n22.00 (18.00) We're going to leave it there for the night. Please check our US Election page for the latest.\n\nTwitter: Chris Geidner - Both President Obama and Mitt Romney are scheduled to be in Columbus, Ohio, on Monday afternoon. #Ohio #Ohio #Ohio\n\n21.15 (17.15) This could be a game changer: Mr Burns endorses Romney\n\n20.55 (16.55) Paul Ryan is campaigning in Pennsylvania on Saturday and, according to the Daily, Mitt Romney has a surprise rally planned there on Sunday. Which begs the question: are the Republicans serious that are playing to win in the Keystone State or is it a feint?\n\nReal Clear Politics has Obama up 4.6 points there which seems like a big order with five days to go. David Axelrod, Obama's chief strategist is so confident that he said he would shave his moustache off if Romney were able to win any of Pennsylvania, Michigan or Minnesota.\n\nAre we about to see a naked upper lip from David Axelrod?\n\n20.37 (16.37) Apparently Howard Schultz, the head of Starbucks, has also endorsed Obama.\n\nTwitter: CNBC - Starbucks CEO to @CNBC: I am voting for President Obama.\n\n20.30 (16.30) No reaction on the endorsement yet from Jay Carney, the White House press secretary. This from the pool report:\n\nMr. Carney said POTUS did not speak with his newest campaign supporter, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He did not have any reaction to Mr. Bloomberg's endorsement, as he hadn't discussed it with POTUS. He couldn't say whether POTUS is aware of it.\n\n20.25 (16.25) Shortly after the Bloomberg endorsement, Romney announced the support of 150 former prisoners of war. The list begins with John McCain and I imagine is mainly made up of veterans of Vietnam.\n\n20.16 (16.16) Here's our story on Bloomberg's decision to endorse Obama:\n\nMichael Bloomberg, the fiercely independent Mayor of New York, has endorsed President Barack Obama's re-election, saying he is the best candidate to lead the fight against climate change.\n\nMr Bloomberg, whose city is still in partial darkness after the being hit Hurricane Sandy, said Mr Obama had \"taken major steps to reduce our carbon consumption\" while Mitt Romney had \"reversed course\" on his previous environmental stances.\n\nThe billionaire mayor, who has previously been both a Democrat and a Republican but is now an independent, said he also supported Mr Obama's positions on gay marriage and abortion rights.\n\n\"If he listens to people on both sides of the aisle, and builds the trust of moderates, he can fulfill the hope he inspired four years ago and lead our country toward a better future for my children and yours,\" Mr Bloomberg wrote in an article for Bloomberg, the media company he owns.\n\nThe endorsement is a welcome lift for the President, who is trailing his Republican opponent among independent voters by double-digit margins. Mr Bloomberg did not endorse a candidate in 2008 but after indicating that he was prepared to pick a side this year both campaigns assiduously courted his vote.\n\n20.10 (16.10) The Obama campaign seem thrilled with the endorsement from America's most prominent independent politician.\n\nTwitter: Barack Obama - \"When I step into the voting booth, I think about the world I want to leave my 2 daughters.\" Bloomberg endorses Obama: http://t.co/nsue6Q6L\n\n19.20 (15.20) A day after his hugs with Chris Christie, Obama has been endorsed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg, one of the other high-profile leaders of the Sandy crisis.\n\nBloomberg, who at different times has been both a Democrat and a Republican but is now an independent, said he was supporting the President because he believes in gay marriage, abortion rights and fighting climate change.\n\nOne believes a woman’s right to choose should be protected for future generations; one does not. That difference, given the likelihood of Supreme Court vacancies, weighs heavily on my decision.\n\nOne recognizes marriage equality as consistent with America’s march of freedom; one does not. I want our president to be on the right side of history.\n\nOne sees climate change as an urgent problem that threatens our planet; one does not. I want our president to place scientific evidence and risk management above electoral politics.\n\nOf course, neither candidate has specified what hard decisions he will make to get our economy back on track while also balancing the budget. But in the end, what matters most isn’t the shape of any particular proposal; it’s the work that must be done to bring members of Congress together to achieve bipartisan solutions.\n\nPresidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan both found success while their parties were out of power in Congress -- and President Obama can, too. If he listens to people on both sides of the aisle, and builds the trust of moderates, he can fulfill the hope he inspired four years ago and lead our country toward a better future for my children and yours. And that’s why I will be voting for him.\n\n18.55 (14.55) Bill Clinton appears to have come down a case of the Bidens, telling a crowd in Ohio that he's honoured to be in Pennyslvania.\n\nTwitter: Rosalind Helderman - Biden-disease hits Clinton! \"I’m honored to be here in Pennsylvania to support President Obama.\" He says in Ohio. Quickly corrects himself\n\nHere's Biden in Ohio, talking about ads being run \"here in Iowa\".\n\n18.45 (14.45) Romney is speaking at a rally in Doswell, Virginia, right now where a heckler just shouted: \"Climate change caused Sandy! Let's get real!\" It's not a million miles from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's comments immediately after the storm. Here's my story from Tuesday:\n\nThe US may need to build new storm defences as it faces up to more violent weather caused by climate change, the governor of New York has warned.\n\nAndrew Cuomo said that New York seemed to be hit a \"100-year flood every two years now\" as a result of rising sea levels caused by global warming.\n\n\"There has been a series of extreme weather incidents,\" Mr Cuomo said. \"That is not a political statement, that is a factual statement.\"\n\nMr Cuomo said that anyone who did not acknowledge \"a dramatic change in weather patterns\" was \"denying reality\".\n\nHe said New York City was not designed to deal with such serious rises in water levels and may need to invest billions in storm barriers or levees like the type used in New Orleans.\n\n18.30 (14.30) Our US Editor, Peter Foster, shot this little clip of Obama's arrival in Wisconsin a little bit earlier.\n\n18.15 (14.15) David Frum, a former Bush speechwriter and a fairly good weathervane for thinking among the moderate Republican elite, says he will be voting for Romney but would vote Democrat locally to keep Congress out of Republican control.\n\nWould Mitt Romney be an improvement over President Obama? I'd like to believe the David Brooks theory of the Romney presidency: that Romney will pivot away from Tea Party Republicanism as soon as he is elected. I don't see much evidence in support of that theory, alas. George Romney, I'm told, liked to say, \"As you campaign, so shall you govern.\" Mitt Romney's campaign has been one long appeasement of the most selfish and stupid elements of the Republican coalition, and the instinct for appeasement will not terminate with the counting of the votes next Tuesday.\n\nBut I also reject the Jonathan Chait theory that Romney personally shares the beliefs of the selfish and stupid elements of the coalition. Massachusetts Mitt - the Mitt who hurled himself into the battle for universal health coverage within his state - also came from someplace real.\n\n17.50 (13.50) A reminder that while campaigning continues, things are far from back to normal in New York and New Jersey.\n\nTwitter: Alex Wagner - Wow. Con Ed saying power not going to be restored til Nov 10/11th -- and possibly the week after.\n\n17.30 (13.30) This little brouhaha was almost lost amid the gales of Sandy but the Obama campaign is determined to keep it going. Earlier this week, Romney's campaign said that General Motors was outsourcing jobs to China while Chrysler was shifting its Jeep production to the rising Asian country.\n\nThe claims simply weren't true and executives from both companies made rare forays into presidential politics to denounce them. Here's the statement from GM:\n\nWe've clearly entered some parallel universe during these last few days. No amount of campaign politics at its cynical worst will diminish our record of creating jobs in the U.S. and repatriating profits back to this country.\n\nThe Obama campaign is determined to keep reminding voters in the car-making Midwest of the undignified little fracas and has a new ad out today attacking Romney on the issue.\n\n17.15 (13.15) The White House is stressing that while Obama may be out campaigning he's still fully engaged in the post-Sandy recovery effort. He was briefed by the head of FEMA this morning at the White House and en route to Green Bay spoke to the governors of West Virginia and Connecticut. More conference calls are planned throughout the day.\n\n17.05 (13.05) As Obama shook hands in Wisconsin, he was surrounded by his usual phalanx of Secret Service bodyguards. Today in Washington, the Service is honouring Officer Leslie Coffelt, who was killed on November 1, 1950, protecting President Truman from an assassination attempt by Puerto Rican nationalists.\n\nTwitter: U.S. Secret Service - 4/5: To date, Coffelt remains the only @SecretService member killed during an assassination attempt #SecretServiceHistory\n\n16.50 (12.50) Romney's campaign is up with a new Spanish language ad in Miami linking Obama to Hugo Chavez, Fidel Castro and Che Guevara. Here's the translation by the Miami Herald.\n\nCHAVEZ: If I were American, I’d vote for Obama.\n\nNARRATOR: And to top it off, Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency sent emails for Hispanic Heritage month with a photo of Che Guevara.\n\nCHAVEZ: If Obama were from Barlovento (a Venezuelan town), he’d vote for Chávez.\n\n16.40 (12.40) There was relatively little new stuff in Romney's speech in Virginia a little while ago, but he did aggressively attack Obama's suggestion that America set up a Department of Business - highlighting it as a symptom of the President's government-can-solve-anything attitude.\n\nNow, I know the president's been trying to figure out some way to suggest he's got some new ideas, because with all these people out of work, with 3 million more women in poverty today than when he took office, with 15 more million people on food stamps than when he took office, he's got to find something to suggest it's going to be better over the next four years.\n\nAnd so he came up with an idea last week, which is he's going to create the department of business. I don't think adding a new chair in his Cabinet will help add millions of jobs on Main Street. I mean, unfortunately, what you've seen before your very eyes is a campaign that keeps on shrinking and shrinking and shrinking to smaller things.\n\n16.31 (12.31) The magazine's 2008 cover, showing a younger-looking Obama with his Blackberry strapped to his belt (then: ultra-modern, today: a bit naff) was one of the iconic frontpages of the last election.\n\n16.30 (12.30) The Economist has endorsed Barack Obama, though with none of the enthusiasm with which it backed him in 2008.\n\nFour years ago, The Economist endorsed Barack Obama for the White House with enthusiasm. So did millions of voters. Next week Americans will trudge to the polls far less hopefully. So (in spirit at least) will this London-based newspaper. Having endured a miserably negative campaign, the world’s most powerful country now has a much more difficult decision to make than it faced four years ago.\n\nThat is in large part because of the woeful nature of Mr Obama’s campaign. A man who once personified hope and centrism set a new low by unleashing attacks on Mitt Romney even before the first Republican primary. Yet elections are about choosing somebody to run a country. And this choice turns on two questions: how good a president has Mr Obama been, especially on the main issues of the economy and foreign policy? And can America really trust the ever-changing Mitt Romney to do a better job? On that basis, the Democrat narrowly deserves to be re-elected.\n\n16.15 (12.15) Obama made a point of talking about bipartisanship today, although not at any cost. It came a day after his appearance with Chris Christie but also as ads touting the endorsement of Colin Powell, a Republican, ran in swing states across the country.\n\n16.05 (12.05) Obama is making a real effort to reclaim some of the hopefulness of the 2008 - saying that he has fought against vested interests in Washington \"who would shut your voices out\". He says this anonymous host of Republicans and insurance companies and oil corporations and big banks had a strategy to \"engineer pure gridlock from the start in Congress\".\n\nHe says he will never \"surrender to the same status quo that has hurt middle class families for way too long\". He promises he will be the champion of the Americans \"whose letters I read late at night\" - teachers, autoworkers, small business owners and kids in the inner cities and in the small towns.\n\n16.00 (12.00) Obama attacks Romney's claim to be the candidate of change: \"Let me tell you Wisconsin, we know what change looks like and what Mitt Romney is offering isn't change\". Somewhat tenuously he accuses Romney of wanting to go back to the polices of George W Bush but also wanting to \"rubber stamp the Tea Party's agenda\". It can't really be both.\n\n15.58 (11.58) Obama goes on a Clintoneque riff about how America's challenges - globalisation, rapidly advancing foreign competitors - were not going to melt away but they could be boldly faced. And then he invokes Clinton directly, saying \"for eight years we had a President who shared those values\" and who created economic growth and surpluses.\n\n15.56 (11.56) Obama begins by thanking the home of the Green Bay Packers for welcoming a Chicago Bears fan so warmly. And then he turns to the storm, saying they mourn for those who died and will support those who lost so much.\n\nWe have also been inspired these past few days because when disaster strikes we see America at its best. All the petty differences that consume us in normal times seem to melt away. There are no Democrats or Republicans in the storm - there are just Americans.\n\n15.55 (11.55) Oh the advantages of being President: you get your own plane AND your own leather jacket.\n\n15.45 (11.45) The crowd goes understandably crazy as the President's plane pulls up right in front of them.\n\nWisconsin is like a lot of its neighbours in the Midwest: Obama has shown small but fairly consistent leads all the way through the election. Current polling from RCP puts him 3.7 points ahead, although the Republicans are pushing hard in Paul Ryan's homestate.\n\n15.30 (11.30) From the iced keys of his Blackberry, Peter Foster sends this picture of the crowd awaiting the President's arrival in Wisconsin. Air Force One just touched down and is going to pull up almost directly in front of the rally.\n\nFinger-numbing cold in Green Bay, Wisconsin where Barack Obama is dues to land shortly and will speak before 12 noon EY. If ever there was a test of party loyalty, it was standing for two hours in line to get into this event. Brrrrrr.\n\n15.20 (11.20) As Obama flew over the ruined beaches of New Jersey yesterday he was greeted with the word \"Romney\" written in the sand. It looks like someone added \"sucks\" underneath it but that's been partially scrubbed out.\n\n15.05 (11.05) The Real Clear Politics average has Romney and Obama tied on 47.4, both still shy of the 50 per cent barrier. Worth noting that Romney is probably ahead but that his average has gone down because the Gallup tracker - which usually puts him five points up - has been out of business during the storm.\n\n14.50 (10.50) A lot of Republicans have been muttering about Chris Christie's decision to so emphatically embrace Obama less than a week before the election.\n\nThe big man from New Jersey was seen as a huge asset to Mitt during the Republican primary battle but at the time of the convention things tensed up a bit. Christie used his high-profile keynote address to talk mainly about himself, mentioning the Republican nominee only in passing.\n\nSome in the party have noted that he faces his own re-election battle in 2013, fighting in a Democrat state and that being seen with the President is no bad thing. Here's Rush Limbaugh deriding him as a \"Greek column\" for Obama's re-election campaign (and also seemingly mocking the people who left everything on the Jersey Shore but hey-ho).\n\n14.45 (10.45) Standing to Romney's right is George Allen, the Republican candidate for Senate in Virginia. Allen is a former governor and a former US Senator, which you would think would virtually guarantee him victory. But his opponent Tim Kaine is also a former governor (Virginia has a one-term limit for governor, meaning that there a lot of them floating around and looking for new jobs).\n\nThe Virginia senate race has been one of the closest and least predictable of the 2012 cycle, with polls showing Kaine just a single point ahead.\n\n14.35 (10.35) Romney is standing in front of a yellow truck as he slams the President's suggestion that the US should have a cabinet-level Secretary of Business.\n\nI don't think adding a chair in his cabinet will add more jobs to Main Street.\n\n14.22 (10.22) Romney's focus today is on Virginia, the formerly safe Republican state that went Democrat in 2008 for the first time in 1964. Romney's aides had hoped to have Old Dominion and its 13 electoral votes locked down by now but the polls show it is still neck and neck. The Republican had to cancel to three events over the weekend due to the storm but is speaking in Roanoke now.\n\nWe really can't afford four more years like the last four years. I know that the Obama folks are chanting four more years, four more years. But chant is this: five more days, five more days.\n\n14.10 (10.10) If you're four years old this election has basically been going on for half of your life. For little Abigael Evans it was all a bit too much. Don't worry, Abby, only five days to go.\n\n13.50 (09.50) Just because there wasn't any campaigning from the Obama team that's not to say there wasn't politics. Obama flew into New Jersey yesterday where he and the brash Republican governor Chris Christie put on a show of bipartisanship that bordered on bromance, as Nick Allen reports.\n\nThe response to Hurricane Sandy has seen an extraordinary and unlikely working relationship develop between President Barack Obama and Chris Christie, the combative Republican Governor of New Jersey.\n\nMr Christie, an influential supporter of presidential challenger Mitt Romney, had been strongly critical of Mr Obama in the past, accusing him of showing \"absentee leadership in the Oval Office.\"\n\nBut, just days ahead of the Nov 6 election, the disaster has turned the two men into a bipartisan double act, each making a public show of setting aside political differences, and praising the other's efforts.\n\nAt one point they passed over an area where someone had etched \"ROMNEY\" in large letters in a sand drift.\n\n13.40 (09.40) The President returns to the campaign trail for the first time today since Superstorm Sandy forced him to call of Monday's joint appearance with Bill Clinton in Florida. But he's making up for lost time with a grueling schedule that will see him in Wisconsin, Colorado and Nevada today before heading to Ohio.\n\nHe spends all day Friday in the crucial Buckeye State - where a win could be enough to get him re-elected - and then heads to Iowa, Wisconsin, Virginia and Ohio (again) on Saturday.\n\n13.30 BST (09.30 EST) Good morning and welcome back to our coverage of the US Election .\n\nUS Election: October 26 as it happened\n\nUS Election: October 25 as it happened\n\nUS Election: October 24 as it happened\n\nUS Election: October 23 - as it happened\n\nThird Presidential debate: as it happened\n\nUS Election: Oct 19 as it happened\n\nUS Election: October 18 as it happened\n\nUS presidential debate reaction: October 17 as it happened\n\nUS election - presidential debate October 16: as it happened\n\nUS election: October 15 at it happed\n\nUS election - Oct 10 as it happened\n\nUS election - Oct 9 as it happened\n\nUS election - Oct 8 as it happened\n\nUS election - October 5 as it happend\n\nUS election - October 4 as it happened\n\nUS election - presidential debate October 3 as it happened\n\nUS election - October 2 as it happened\n\nUS Election - October 1 as it happened\n\nUS Election 2012 - September 28 as it happened\n\nUS Election 2012 - September 27 as it happened\n\nUS Election 2012 - September 26 as it happened\n\nUS Election 2012 - September 25 as it happened\n\nUS Election 2012 - Sep 24 as it happened\n\nUS Election 2012 - Sep 21 as it happened\n\nUS Election 2012 - September 20 as it happened\n\nUS Election 2012 - September 19 as it happened\n\nUS Election 2012 - September 18 as it happened\n\nUS Election 2012 - September 17 - as it happened\n\nUS election 2012: September 11 - as it happened\n\nCampaign trail: September 10 as it happened", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:08:25.142-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:08:25.142-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/us/politics/obama-tours-storm-ravaged-new-jersey-with-gov-chris-christie.html", "title" : "Obama Tours Storm-Ravaged New Jersey With Gov. Chris Christie", "text" : "WASHINGTON — President Obama toured the storm-tossed boardwalks of New Jersey’s ravaged coastline on Wednesday, in a vivid display of big-government muscle and bipartisan harmony that confronted Mitt Romney with a vexing challenge just as he returned to the campaign trail in Florida.\n\nThe scene of Mr. Obama greeting his onetime political antagonist Gov. Chris Christie in Atlantic City was a striking departure from what has become an increasingly bitter campaign, marked by sharp divisions between Mr. Romney’s more limited view of the federal role and Mr. Obama’s more expansive vision. The president placed a hand on Mr. Christie’s back and guided him to Marine One, where the two men shared a grim flight over shattered sea walls, burning houses and a submerged roller coaster.\n\nSpeaking to storm victims at a community center in the hard-hit town of Brigantine, Mr. Obama said, “We are going to be here for the long haul.” Mr. Christie thanked the president for his visit, saying, “It’s really important to have the president of the United States acknowledge all the suffering that’s going on here in New Jersey.”\n\nThe tableau of bipartisan cooperation, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s highly visible role in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, has put Mr. Romney in an awkward position during the last week of a campaign in which he has fought Mr. Obama to a virtual draw. Last year, in a debate during the Republican primary, Mr. Romney appeared to advocate handing to the states much of the federal government’s role in dealing with major disasters.\n\nOn Wednesday, as images of Mr. Obama and Mr. Christie dominated the newscasts, Mr. Romney was in Florida, a key electoral battleground that is no stranger to destructive hurricanes, where he struggled to square his small-government credo with a national disaster that seemed to cry out for a major federal response.\n\nBefore taking the stage at his first rally in Tampa, Mr. Romney issued a statement pledging to continue financing FEMA to insure it can “fulfill its mission.”\n\n“I believe that FEMA plays a key role in working with states and localities to prepare for and respond to natural disasters,” Mr. Romney said. But reaffirming his earlier point, he added that he would channel resources to “the first responders who work tirelessly to help those in need, because states and localities are in the best position to get aid to the individuals and communities affected by natural disasters.”\n\nAides to Mr. Romney reiterated that Mr. Romney was not backing away from comments he made at the debate in New Hampshire in June 2011. When asked about a fierce battle in Congress over continued financing of FEMA, Mr. Romney declared, “We cannot afford to do these things without jeopardizing the future for our kids.”\n\nAs the Romney campaign was confronting questions about the candidate’s position on the federal role in emergency response, Mr. Obama and Mr. Christie were being accompanied on their tour of a devastated New Jersey by FEMA’s administrator, W. Craig Fugate, whose agency has won unstinting praise from Mr. Christie, a Republican, for the speed and intensity of its response to the devastation.\n\nKevin Madden, a senior Romney adviser, said that Mr. Romney still believes that states, not the federal government, should lead the response to disasters.

They are doing their level best to do the best for their students and they are bound, given the pressures they are under, to take the most optimistic view.\n\n\"There's an amount of tolerance... some leeway in the marking. But if enough teachers mark up to that tolerance, mark up to that limit, then overall it has a national effect,\" she added.\n\nThis summer's English GCSEs were a new modular qualification, with pupils sitting written exam papers and controlled assessment, and schools decided when pupils submitted that assessment work and sat exams.\n\nOfqual's research found many schools used the marks pupils received in their first exams and the January grade boundaries to work out what score a pupil would need in their controlled assessment to get a certain grade and marked it accordingly.\n\nMost of the controlled assessment work was submitted in the summer and when examiners saw evidence of over-marking, exam boards raised grade boundaries, leading some pupils to receive poorer grades than expected.\n\nIn Wales, ministers ordered a regrade for pupils who got a lower grade than expected with Welsh board WJEC, but Ofqual did not order such a move in England.\n\nNow an alliance of pupils, schools, councils and professional bodies has launched a legal challenge over the fiasco, calling for results to be re-graded.\n\nSchools in England are measured on the percentage of pupils who get five A*-C GCSEs, including English and maths.\n\nThis measure is included in league tables, with schools expected to have at least 40% of students reaching this standard.\n\nThe Ofqual report says the new qualifications \"reinforced the trend\" of schools running the GCSE schools years (Years 10 and 11) as a \"tactical operation to secure certain grades and combinations of grades\".\n\n\"This has come to be seen as 'what good schools do' despite the awareness of many teachers and parents that the concept of broad and deep learning can get lost along the way,\" it says.\n\nOfqual says it will take action to ensure there are no repeats of this year's problems in 2013.\n\nThe watchdog also says this year's debacle proves the proposal by Education Secretary Michael Gove to end the modularisation of GCSEs in England by 2014 is correct.\n\nMs Stacey said the new modular English GCSEs at the heart of the fiasco were too flexible and \"not sufficiently resilient\" to take the pressure they were put under.\n\n\"It is so flexible that, when subjected to the pressure of the accountability system, it can buckle,\" she said.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : {

less academically gifted were entered for CSEs.\n\nWhile a top grade at CSE was technically equivalent to a C at O-level, it was not always viewed in this light, particularly by employers.\n\nBack

Major U.S. networks projected that Obama had achieved his long-sought goal of four more years in the White House even before some of the key battleground states were declared, such as Florida, Virginia and Nevada.\n\nObama had won much of the traditionally Democratic northeastern U.S. early in the night, including Pennsylvania, while Republican challenger Romney secured the conservative base across a swath of states including Texas and Georgia.\n\nBut the president sealed his victory with wins in Ohio, Iowa, New Hampshire and Colorado, four of nine battleground states where the two rivals and their allies spent nearly $1 billion on duelling television commercials.\n\nLate Tuesday night, Romney reportedly called Obama to concede the election, and later addressed a crowd of supporters gathered at his campaign headquarters in Boston.\n\n\"This is a time of great challenges for America, and I pray that the president will be successful in guiding our nation,\" Romney said in a brief speech.\n\n\"The nation as you know is at a critical point. At a time like this, we can't risk partisan bickering and political posturing,\" he said. \"Our leaders have to reach across the aisle to do the people's work, and we citizens also have to rise to the occasion.\"\n\nRomney also thanked his running mate, Paul Ryan, saying that \"besides my wife Ann, Paul is the best choice I've ever made.\"\n\nThe two rivals were close in the popular vote. With votes counted in 88 per cent of the nation's precincts, Obama had received 55.8 million votes, or about 49.8 per cent. Romney. Romney had 54.5 million, or 48.6 percent.\n\nResults were still trickling in early Wednesday, but The Associated Press showed Obama with more than 300 electoral votes to Romneys 206.\n\nDemocrats were in a partying mood over news of Obama's re-election.\n\nIn Obama's hometown of Chicago, the U.S. network projections prompted roars of jubilation that CBC's Neil Macdonald said lasted for at least 10 minutes.\n\nBut the security of having a second term comes with high expectations for the next four years. Macdonald noted that Obama's efforts at reaching across the aisle with his Republican colleagues led to chronic frustration during his first term.\n\n\"He was rebuffed at every turn. He was obstructed by the Republicans. Time to stop playing softball; time to dispense with this nonsense,\" Macdonald said. \"You don't have to get re-elected. Time to get priorities passed.\"\n\nUltimately, the result of the bruising election campaign appeared to be a return to the political status quo. Democrats won two more years of control of the Senate, and Republicans did likewise in the House.\n\nBoth the Obama and Romney camps cast the election day decision as one with far-reaching repercussions for a nation still recovering from the biggest economic downturn since the Great Depression and at odds over how big a role government should play in solving the country's staggering debt and high unemployment.\n\nObama will be tasked with a laundry list of pressing issues in his second term, including whether to scrap the Bush tax cuts, how to fill expected Supreme Court vacancies, and how to navigate the U.S. \"fiscal cliff\" negotiations, which are set to begin after Tuesday's votes are tallied.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:09:03.939-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:09:03.939-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/07/us/politics/obama-romney-presidential-election-2012.html?hp", "title" : "Divided U.S. Gives Obama More Time", "text" : "Barack Hussein Obama was re-elected president of the United States on Tuesday, overcoming powerful economic headwinds, a lock-step resistance to his agenda by Republicans in Congress and an unprecedented torrent of advertising as a divided nation voted to give him more time.\n\nIn defeating Mitt Romney, the president carried Colorado, Iowa, Ohio, New Hampshire, Virginia and Wisconsin, a near sweep of the battleground states, and was holding a narrow advantage in Florida. The path to victory for Mr. Romney narrowed as the night wore along, with Mr. Obama winning at least 303 electoral votes.\n\nA cheer of jubilation sounded at the Obama campaign headquarters in Chicago when the television networks began projecting him as the winner at 11:20 p.m., even as the ballots were still being counted in many states where voters had waited in line well into the night. The victory was far narrower than his historic election four years ago, but it was no less dramatic.\n\n“Tonight in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back,” Mr. Obama told his supporters early Wednesday. “We know in our hearts that for the United States of America, the best is yet to come.”\n\nMr. Obama’s re-election extended his place in history, carrying the tenure of the nation’s first black president into a second term. His path followed a pattern that has been an arc to his political career: faltering when he seemed to be at his strongest — the period before his first debate with Mr. Romney — before he redoubled his efforts to lift himself and his supporters to victory.\n\nThe evening was not without the drama that has come to mark so many recent elections: For more than 90 minutes after the networks projected Mr. Obama as the winner, Mr. Romney held off calling him to concede. And as the president waited to declare victory in Chicago, Mr. Romney’s aides were prepared to head to the airport, suitcases packed, potentially to contest several close results.\n\nBut as it became increasingly clear that no amount of contesting would bring him victory, he called Mr. Obama to concede shortly before 1 a.m.\n\n“I wish all of them well, but particularly the president, the first lady and their daughters,” Mr. Romney told his supporters in Boston. “This is a time of great challenges for America, and I pray that the president will be successful in guiding our nation.”\n\nHispanics made up an important part of Mr. Obama’s winning coalition, preliminary exit poll data showed. And before the night was through, there were already recriminations from Republican moderates who said Mr. Romney had gone too far during the primaries in his statements against those here illegally, including his promise that his get-tough policies would cause some to “self-deport.”\n\nMr. Obama, 51, faces governing in a deeply divided country and a partisan-rich capital, where Republicans retained their majority in the House and Democrats kept their control of the Senate. His re-election offers him a second chance that will quickly be tested, given the rapidly escalating fiscal showdown.\n\nFor Mr. Obama, the result brings a ratification of his sweeping health care act, which Mr. Romney had vowed to repeal. The law will now continue on course toward nearly full implementation in 2014, promising to change significantly the way medical services are administered nationwide.\n\nConfident that the economy is finally on a true path toward stability, Mr. Obama and his aides have hinted that he would seek to tackle some of the grand but unrealized promises of his first campaign, including the sort of immigration overhaul that has eluded presidents of both parties for decades.\n\nBut he will be venturing back into a Congressional environment similar to that of his first term, with the Senate under the control of Democrats and the House under the control of Republicans, whose leaders have hinted that they will be no less likely to challenge him than they were during the last four years.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:09:05.539-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:09:05.539-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/07/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-massachusetts-senate-scott-brown.html", "title" : "Warren Unseats Brown for Massachusetts Senate Seat", "text" : "BOSTON — Elizabeth Warren won a hard-fought race for the Senate on Tuesday, recapturing for the Democrats the seat held for almost half a century by Edward M. Kennedy.\n\n“This victory belongs to you,” Ms. Warren told her cheering supporters from a stage. She promised to “hold the big guys accountable.”\n\nThe Senate seat had slipped — temporarily, as it turned out — into Republican hands when Scott P. Brown, a state legislator, won it in a special election in 2010 after Mr. Kennedy’s death. Taking it back was a Democratic priority.\n\n“To all the women of Massachusetts,” Ms. Warren said, addressing her female supporters, a phrase that won more cheers.“After working your tails off, you better believe it, we’re going to fight for equal pay for equal work.”\n\n“You taught a scrappy first-time candidate how to get into the ring and win,” she said. She closed by noting that Mr. Kennedy was first elected to the Senate 50 years ago, and she vowed to continue his fight.\n\nWith the win, Ms. Warren, 63, a Harvard professor who set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the Obama administration, becomes the first woman to represent Massachusetts in the Senate. She had made a forceful appeal to women, who overwhelmingly supported her bid, while more men favored Mr. Brown.\n\nShe cast herself as a fighter for the middle class and a champion of women’s causes. In her closing message to voters, she said Mr. Brown occasionally cast good votes but he was unreliable because he had voted against equal pay for equal work, health insurance coverage for birth control and a Supreme Court nominee who supported abortion rights. It was a message that resonated with Elizabeth Lear, 46, a book reviewer in Waltham, who said she voted for Ms. Warren because “she cares about the financial concerns of everybody and most importantly about women’s reproductive rights, the freedom to choose.”\n\nAnd, Ms. Lear added, “I feel she’s pretty scrappy and I really like that about her.”\n\nMr. Brown cast Ms. Warren as a partisan and inflexible ideologue who would march in lock step with the Democratic Party. At the same time, Mr. Brown presented himself as a bipartisan senator with an independent voice, one who would cross the aisle to solve problems.\n\nBut as a Republican in a strong Democratic state, Mr. Brown was clearly at a disadvantage. President Obama easily carried the state, and Mr. Brown, a longtime ally of the Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, even used Mr. Obama’s images in his campaign advertising.\n\nMs. Warren, who specialized in bankruptcy law, set up the new consumer protection office for President Obama. But he did not appoint her to lead it because Republicans, viewing her as unfriendly to Wall Street, vowed to block her.\n\nTheir race cost more than $68 million, making it one of the most expensive Senate races in the country. With the help of progressive groups that bolstered her candidacy early, she raised $39 million, which put her among the top five most successful Senate fund-raisers of all time. The money was all the more remarkable considering that Ms. Warren was a first-time, untested candidate.\n\n“We raised money from more donors than any Senate campaign in the history of the United States,” Ms. Warren said in a statement about an hour after the polls closed Tuesday and before she made her victory speech at the Fairmont Copley Plaza hotel here. She added, “We knocked on more doors and made more phone calls than any candidate in the history of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.”", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:09:11.636-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:09:11.636-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57546138/mccaskill-to-win-missouri-senate-cbs-news-projects/", "title" : "McCaskill wins Missouri Senate over Akin", "text" : "Republican Rep.

While the state already has a law barring same-sex marriage, conservatives hoped to prevent a future Legislature or court decision from reversing it.\n\nIn Washington State, supporters of a referendum authorizing same-sex marriage appeared to have an edge in pre-election polls, but final results were not expected until later this week because ballots were still being mailed in as late as Tuesday.\n\nLaurie Carlsson, 33, stood on a freeway overpass with a sign urging drivers to honk for the referendum.\n\n“Seattleites do not use their horns — ever — but today they’re honking,” Ms. Carlsson said as a deafening roar erupted. “It’s making me giddy.”\n\nIt has been a constant theme of opponents of same-sex marriage that whenever it has been put before voters it has lost. In 30 states, voters have limited marriage to a man and a woman through constitutional amendments, and same-sex marriage has also been blocked in referendums like those in California in 2008 and Maine in 2009.\n\nThis year, the legislatures in Washington and Maryland approved same-sex marriage, but opponents gathered enough signatures to force referendums. In Maine, since their loss in 2009, gay rights advocates have been cultivating public opinion in one-on-one conversations, and this year sponsored their successful repeat election.\n\nIn the final week of the campaign, the opponents of marriage rights, mainly financed by the National Organization for Marriage and the Roman Catholic Church, mounted a barrage of advertising and telephone appeals in all four states, trying to convince undecided voters that “redefining marriage” would force schools to “teach gay marriage” and require businesses and churches to violate religious principles.\n\nRights groups have denounced those messages as misleading scare tactics and say they do not seek to redefine marriage but to end discrimination.\n\nFor many weeks, reflecting their more than threefold advantage in fund-raising nationwide, advocates of same-sex marriage have unleashed advertisements of their own in which community members say that gay and lesbian friends deserve the same chance to love and marry that others enjoy.\n\nPre-election polling in Washington State indicated that a slight majority of voters supported the referendum. “We have weathered their waves of attacks and not lost any ground,” said Zach Silk, the campaign manager of Washington United for Marriage, in an interview before the voting began.\n\nFrank Schubert, who managed the campaigns to ban same-sex marriage in all four states, disputed the notion that Tuesday’s ballots were a major turning point. “The votes are very close everywhere,” he said.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:09:15.609-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:09:15.609-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-gay-marriage-20121107,0,1194693.story", "title" : "Voters approve gay marriage in Maine, Maryland", "text" : "Wins in Maine and Maryland are a first for same-sex marriage at the ballot box as advocates see public opinion shifting.

But activists said public opinion had shifted since 2008, when California passed a constitutional amendment reserving marriage for heterosexual couples. A 2010 poll showed that, for the first time, more Americans supported gay marriage than opposed it, and in May, President Obama endorsed same-sex marriage.\n\nCLEVELAND — Maine and Maryland became the first states to back same-sex marriage at the ballot box Tuesday night, buoying gay rights advocates and breaking a years-long losing streak.\n\nMaine's initiative, Question 1, had asked voters to allow officials to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Just three years ago, the state defeated a same-sex marriage bill at the ballot box. But a lengthy campaign to change voters' minds persuaded some Mainers, said David Farmer, spokesman for Mainers United for Marriage.\n\n\"We've had more than 250,000 one-on-one conversations with people; we are confident that those personal connections have worked to move folks,\" he said earlier. With 64% of precincts reporting late Tuesday, Question 1 held an eight-point lead and the Associated Press projected its passage.\n\nMaryland and Washington had been considered toss-ups. In both states, the Legislature passed and a Democratic governor signed a bill allowing same-sex marriage. And in both states, opponents collected enough signatures for a referendum on the law, putting it on hold in the meantime.\n\nWhen Maryland upheld the law, 52% to 48%, it became the first state below the Mason-Dixon line to legalize gay marriage.\n\n\"Fairness and equality under the law won tonight,\" said Josh Levin, campaign manager for Marylanders for Marriage Equality. \"We're sure to feel the ripples of this monumental victory across the country for years to come.\"\n\nWashington state's website listed that state's referendum with a lead, but complete results will not be available until at least Wednesday. That's because the vast majority of voters do so by mail, and have until election day to mail their ballots.\n\nIn Minnesota, if voters side with gay-rights advocates, same-sex marriage will remain illegal because of existing law. The current measure seeks to put a same-sex marriage ban into the state's constitution. With half of precincts reporting, the race was nearly even.\n\nBefore Tuesday night, gay marriage was legal in the District of Columbia and six states — Vermont, Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and New York. But 30 states have constitutional amendments prohibiting it, and 11 more — including Minnesota — have laws banning it.\n\nFor some voters, this election seemed eerily similar to 2008, when Obama was running for president and an anti-gay marriage initiative was on the California ballot. Obama won, but so did Proposition 8, which overruled a state Supreme Court decision and added an amendment to the state constitution defining marriage as between one man and one woman. In 2010, a federal judge rejected Proposition 8, but his ruling is on hold pending appeal.\n\nLos Angeles TV writer Jen Braeden, 32, remembered the disappointment of 2008 and, earlier Tuesday, was wary about the referendum in her home state of Maryland. Braeden, who lives with her girlfriend of three years in Mount Washington, said she would like to wed if same-sex marriage becomes legal in Maryland, but wasn't ready to get her hopes up.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:09:17.712-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:09:17.712-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-gay-marriage-measures-maryland-maine-20121106,0,7264088.story", "title" : "Same-sex marriage measures passing in Maryland and Maine", "text" : "“If Obama is reelected and if we pass two or three of these state ballot initiatives, this is good, solid momentum on behalf of equality,” he said. “It shows that Americans are willing to support equality at the ballot box.”\n\nA win in any of the four states would suggest that momentum is on the side of gay marriage activists, said Fred Sainzo, a spokesman at the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group that has donated $5 million to gay marriage proponents in the four states.\n\nThe issue had been before voters 32 times and had been rejected every time.

Many Israelis are worried about how the frosty first-term relationship will affect Obama's actions during his second term.\n\nA brush with death in the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq\n\nChuck Todd (helped by Obama) launches his ‘Meet the Press.’ So how did he do?\n\nIn this March 5 file photo, President Barack Obama meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington.\n\nIsraeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu was quick to congratulate President Obama on his reelection by paying tribute to an US-Israel alliance that, in his words, is \"rock solid,\" though the upbeat statement belied widespread anxiety by Israelis that the leaders’ rocky relations would continue to cloud ties.\n\nNow that Mr. Obama is free of the constraints of reelection, Israelis worry that he will feel less compelled to mollify Mr. Netanyahu on disputes over the Palestinian peace process and blocking Iran’s nuclear program. Obama has pushed Israel to renew talks with the Palestinians and has refused a request from Netanyahu to publicly set a \"red line\" for military action against Iran’s nuclear program.\n\nAlluding to the tension with language that seemed lifted from GOP candidate Mitt Romney's talking points, parliament member Danny Danon, a member of Netanyahu's Likud Party, expressed hope the president \"resets his course relating to Israel and our region for the next four years. Rather than dictating ill-advised policies that endanger the wellbeing of America's only true ally in the Middle East, now is the time for President Obama to return to the wise and time-honored policy of 'zero daylight' between our respective nations.''\n\nIf Obama pushes more diplomatic talks with Iran while allowing it to continue to enrich uranium, sore spots with the US are likely persist like they did late into the election campaign, says one political expert.\n\n\"We all know that relations between Obama and Netanyahu have been tense at times,\" says Ephraim Inbar, a political science professor at Bar Ilan University. \"Israel will have difficulty swallowing\" policies considered to be \"appeasement\" of Iran.\n\nDuring the past four years, Israelis have often described relations as sinking to a two-decade low as a result of the flare-ups.\n\nThe Palestinians, however, see Obama’s relations with Israel differently. Though Obama pressured Israel, they were disappointed because he let up on demands for a halt in settlement activity.\n\nNonetheless, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat called on the president to make sure that a Palestinian state is established before his time in office is up.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister, who is gearing up for his own reelection campaign that is expected to highlight his handling of foreign affairs, was put on the defensive on Wednesday morning as his surrogates hustled to fended off renewed allegations that Mr. Netanyahu had wrongly intervened in the US campaign on behalf of Mr. Romney, and that Israel might pay a diplomatic price.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Tel Aviv, US Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro sought to quash that line of thinking.\n\n\"The president is a very strategic thinker,\" he said. \"And that means that he’s not somebody whose policies are governed by emotion. Nor I would say are they policies which are governed by politics.''\n\nIndeed, former diplomats and political analysts suggested that some of the anxiety is overplayed, because the ties between the allies are more robust than the sometimes rocky relations between the two leaders. They pointed to a weeks-long joint missile-defense training involving thousands of soldiers as evidence of the alliance’s durability.\n\nThat sentiment can be found on the ground in Israel as well. One Netanyahu supporter expressed hope the prime minister could mend fences. Another supporter of the prime minister said he isn’t worried about Obama’s reelection because he has many pro-Israel advisers and has already come to Israel’s defense in the United Nations.\n\n\"Even though there has been tension between Bibi and Obama,\" says Ravi Dagan, a boutique owner, \"the president has been there for us.\"", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:09:20.213-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:09:20.213-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-20236365", "title" : "Obama's re-election: The world reacts", "text" : "A round-up of international reaction from world leaders and key players to the re-election of Barack Obama to a second term as US president.\n\n\"The United States is a key strategic partner of the European Union and we look forward to continuing the close co-operation established with President Obama over these last four years, to further strengthening our bilateral ties and to jointly addressing global challenges, including in the fields of security and economy,\" they said in a joint statement.\n\nThey also \"look forward to meeting President Obama at an early date in order to reconfirm our priorities and provide renewed impetus to our joint action\".\n\nMr Hollande hailed President Obama's re-election as a \"clear choice for an open, united America that is totally engaged on the international scene\".\n\nHis victory would \"once again reinforce our partnership to facilitate the return of economic growth in our countries, to fight unemployment, and to find solutions to crises that threaten us, notably in the Middle East\".\n\n\"I have deeply appreciated our many meetings and conversations about all the issues involved in developing the German-American and the transatlantic relationship, not least in overcoming the global financial and economic crisis.\"\n\n\"One of the first things I want to talk to Barack about is how we must do more to try and solve this crisis [in Syria].

With those ballots counted, support for statehood was calculated to be closer to 45 percent, analysts said.\n\nThe referendum was backed by Republican Governor Luis Fortuno of the New Progressive Party which supports statehood.\n\nOn Wednesday, he conceded defeat in Puerto Rico's gubernatorial race after narrowly losing his re-election bid.\n\nFortuno's main rival was Senator Alejandro Garcia Padilla of the pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party, or PDP.\n\n\"I accept the will of the people and congratulate Governor-elect Alejandro Garcia Padilla,\" Fortuno said.\n\nRELATED: ELECTION DAY: DEMOCRATS RETAIN THE SENATE WHILE THE GOP KEEPS ITS GRIP ON THE HOUSE\n\nWith 96 percent of the voting stations reporting, Garcia Padilla had 47.85 percent and Fortuno had 47.04 percent, according to Puerto Rico's State Elections Commission.\n\nThe governor's race played out against pressing issues like a stagnant economy, stubborn unemployment of 13.6 percent and a high level of violent crime fueled by drug trafficking, with a record-breaking 1,117 murders being registered on the island last year.\n\nAhead of the vote, Wall Street expressed concern a loss by Fortuno could upset a fiscal restoration plan he implemented that included government layoffs and other belt-tightening measures.\n\nPuerto Rico debt is widely held by U.S. investors because of its unusual full exemption from federal, state and local income taxes, and investors have credited the Fortuno administration with bringing government finances under control and implementing tax and energy reforms.\n\nHowever, Puerto Rico's debt has ballooned to $67 billion, making it among the most indebted jurisdictions in the United States, and economic growth remains tepid, growing by 1.1 percent last year after six years of decline.\n\nDebate over the island's status has long dominated politics in Puerto Rico where voters have opted to remain a U.S. commonwealth in four votes held since 1967, but the margin of victory has decreased over the years.\n\nMost Puerto Ricans pay no federal income tax, but contribute to Social Security and are eligible to receive federal welfare benefits, and many have served in the armed forces.\n\nCommonwealth supporters describe Puerto Rico's relationship with the United States as a bilateral pact that allows the island some autonomy, but critics say it is a colony under the complete authority of the U.S. Congress.\n\nAny change in Puerto Rico's status would have to be approved by the Congress.\n\nIn 1998, the last time voters were asked to choose their status preference, just over 50 percent chose a \"none of the above\" option that was backed by the PDP.\n\nThe party chose not to support a \"commonwealth option\" on the ballot because it was defined as a territorial status subject to congressional authority.\n\nThe United States seized Puerto Rico as war booty from Spain following the Spanish-American war in 1898.

In 1993, support for commonwealth status had shrunk to a 48.6 percent plurality.\n\nFive years later, 50.3 percent of Puerto Ricans casting ballots rejected all three options - statehood, independence and commonwealth - and checked the box marked \"none of the above.\"\n\nOn this week's ballot, voters were first asked whether or not they favored maintaining the island's current status.\n\nThis was the first time in history that the question had been phrased in that way, and 53.99 percent said that they were against the commonwealth.\n\nThen, they were asked, independently of how they might have answered the previous question, to select among statehood, independence and the not clearly defined concept of Sovereign Free Associated State.\n\nAfter his victory, Gov.-elect Garcia Padilla said he will tackle the matter, without giving any additional details how he would do that.\n\nThe flow of millions of dollars in social aid each year from the United States to an island where per capital income is half that of the poorest of the 50 states and the right to carry a U.S. passport have kept Puerto Ricans generally satisfied for decades.\n\nIn March 2010, President Barack Obama's Working Group was the first U.S. delegation to come to Puerto Rico to study ways to resolve the question of the island's sovereignty.

First, by a 54% to 46% margin, voters rejected their current status as a U.S. commonwealth. In a separate question, 61% chose statehood as the alternative, compared with 33% for the semi-autonomous \"sovereign free association\" and 6% for outright independence.\n\nWhile the results may be an indicator of what Puerto Ricans want, statehood will not be possible without congressional action in Washington, something that is not guaranteed.\n\nAn economic downturn and shrinking population were the factors that contributed to the support for statehood, where referendums in 1967, 1993 and 1998 failed, Puerto Rico Secretary of State Kenneth McClintock said.\n\n\"I think people just came to realize that the current relationship simply does not create the number of jobs that we need,\" he said.\n\nAn exodus of residents from the island has culminated in a staggering statistic: Fifty-eight percent of Puerto Ricans live in the mainland United States, McClintock said.\n\n\"When you have a political status that scares away half of your population, it is time to reject that political status,\" he said.\n\nBut some analysts say the views on statehood have not changed, despite Tuesday's results.\n\nThe preference of many voters is to consider a report by the Obama administration that lays out several noncolonial options before choosing an alternative status, said Jorge Benitez, a political scientist at the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras. This option, which is supported by the party that won the governorship, did not appear on the ballot.\n\n\"This isn't to say that support for statehood hasn't increased; it has,\" Benitez said. \"But the only thing we can decipher with certainty from the vote is that the people of Puerto Rico want a change to the current status.\n\n\"It isn't clear what change we want, but we want change,\" he said.\n\nThe results of the referendum met with other criticisms, too.\n\nThere were voters who prefer the current status but didn't agree with the way it was defined on the ballot, thereby inflating the number of votes against the status quo, said Luis Agrait, a history professor at the University of Puerto Rico.\n\nSecondly, a large number of ballots -- one-third of all votes cast -- were left blank on the question of preferred alternative status. If you assume those blank votes are anti-statehood votes, the true result for the statehood option would be less than 50%, Agrait argues.\n\nBut McClintock accounts for the number of blank votes by explaining that those who voted to keep the current status would have left the question of alternatives blank.\n\nThe referendum is nonbinding, but it compels lawmakers in Washington to act, he said.\n\n\"The people are withdrawing their consent to be governed the way they are governed,\" McClintock said, citing the Declaration of Independence, which states that a government's power comes from the consent of those governed.\n\n\"Congress will have to address this and will have to pay attention,\" he said.\n\nThe roughly 4 million residents of Puerto Rico are American citizens but can't vote for president. However, the almost 5 million Puerto Ricans living in the 50 U.S. states have full voting rights.\n\nUnder its status as a commonwealth, Puerto Rico is subject to U.S. federal laws, though island residents are exempt from some federal taxes. Puerto Rico has a nonvoting representative in Congress.\n\nThe territory played a role in presidential politics this year during the GOP primaries, when candidates Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum visited the island, seeking its delegates for the primary election.\n\nSantorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, created a small political firestorm when he said English should be the principal language in Puerto Rico before it could gain statehood.\n\nRomney said he would have \"no preconditions\" on language for Puerto Rico to gain statehood, though during a CNN debate, he said English should be the United States' official language.\n\nLast year, President Barack Obama made an official visit to Puerto Rico, the first such visit by a president in 50 years.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:09:26.759-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:09:26.759-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/11/07/puerto-ricans-choose-statehood-in-non-binding-referendum/", "title" : "Puerto Rico's voters endorse seeking US statehood but ballot results raise questions", "text" : "Puerto Ricans have supported U.S. statehood in a vote that jubilant members of the pro-statehood party say is the strongest sign yet that the Caribbean island territory is on the road to losing its second-class status.\n\nBut Tuesday's vote comes with an asterisk and an imposing political reality: The island remains bitterly divided over its relationship to the United States and many question the validity of this week's referendum.\n\nNearly a half million voters chose to leave a portion of the ballot blank. And voters also ousted the pro-statehood governor, eliminating one of the main advocates for a cause that would need the approval of the U.S. Congress.\n\n\"Statehood won a victory without precedent but it's an artificial victory,\" said Angel Israel Rivera Ortiz, a political science professor at the University of Puerto Rico. \"It reflects a divided and confused electorate that is not clear on where it's going.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama had said he would support the will of the Puerto Rican people on the question of the island's relationship to the U.S., referred to simply on the island as its \"status,\" and this week's referendum was intended to be the barometer.\n\nBut the results aren't so clear cut. It was a two-part ballot that first asked all voters if they favor the current status as a U.S. territory. Regardless of the answer, all voters then had the opportunity to choose in the second question from three options: statehood, independence or \"sovereign free association,\" which would grant more autonomy to the island of nearly 4 million people.\n\nMore than 900,000 voters, or 54 percent, responded \"no\" to the first question, saying they were not content with the current status.\n\nOn the second question, only about 1.3 million voters made a choice. Of those, nearly 800,000, or 61 percent of those expressing an opinion, chose statehood — the first majority after three previous referendums on the issue over the past 45 years. Some 437,000 backed sovereign free association and 72,560 chose independence. Nearly 500,000, however, left that question blank.\n\n\"We made history with this plebiscite,\" said Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi, the island's representative in Congress and a member of both the pro-statehood New Progressive Party and the Democratic Party.\n\nThe certified results will be sent to the White House and the congressional leadership, and it would be up to them to begin the process of possibly admitting Puerto Rico into the union.\n\n\"The ball is now in Congress' court and Congress will have to react to this result,\" Pierluisi said. \"This is a clear result that says 'no' to the current status.\"\n\nGov. Luis Fortuno, a member of the pro-statehood party who is also a Republican, welcomed the results and said he was hopeful that Congress would take up the cause.\n\nBut Fortuno won't be around to lead the fight: Voters turned him out of office after one term, and gave the governship to Alejandro Garcia Padilla of the Popular Democratic Party, which wants Puerto Rico to remain a semi-autonomous U.S. commonwealth.\n\nGarcia has pledged to hold a constitutional assembly in 2014 to address the island's status, followed by another referendum with support from Congress.\n\nMargarita Nolasco, the vice president of the Puerto Rican Senate from the pro-statehood party, said she feared the commonwealth forces would seek to undermine the plebiscite.\n\n\"At the beginning of the last century, statehood appeared to be an impossible dream,\" Nolasco said. \"After a century of battles and electoral defeats, statehood just became the political force of majority that Puerto Ricans prefer.\"\n\nBesides pointing to the defeat of the governor, albeit by a margin of less than 1 percent, skeptics point to other signs that statehood is not ascendant in Puerto Rico.\n\nLuis Delgado Rodriguez, who leads a group that supports sovereign free association, noted all the voters who left the second question blank, raising questions about their preference. He said those voters, coupled with those who support independence and sovereign free association, add up to more than those who favored statehood.\n\n\"This represents an overwhelming majority against statehood,\" he said.\n\nThe results are also murky because everyone could vote in the second round no matter how they marked the first question — and the choice of \"sovereign free association\" is not the same as the current status. So people could have voted for both no change in the first round and any of the choices in the second. Nearly 65,000 left the first question blank.\n\n\"With that kind of message, Congress is not going to do anything, and neither is President Obama,\" Rivera said.\n\nPuerto Rico has been a territory for 114 years and its people have been U.S. citizens since 1917. Residents of the island cannot vote in the U.S. presidential election, have no representation in the Senate and only limited representation in the House of Representatives.\n\nIt's a situation that frustrates many, as does the long-simmering political uncertainty. Independence was once the dominant political movement on the island but no longer: Only 6 percent of voters opted to sever ties from the U.S., a prospect that scared voters like 31-year-old Jose Ramos.\n\n\"I prefer that the United States helps us, because to stand on our own two feet, no,\" said the father of three. \"I don't want this to become a republic.

He said the chief whip, Sir George Young, had taken the \"very sensible decision\" to ensure she is \"no longer a Conservative MP\".\n\n\"The chief whip took the view – and I back this completely – that she had made the decision to go out and do this programme and that meant she couldn't be in parliament, she couldn't represent her constituents and I think people do expect MPs to be doing either one or two of those things, particularly when parliament is sitting.\"\n\nDorries has insisted that Cameron, with whom she has repeatedly clashed, would be glad to see the back of her. \"I am a thorn in his side,\" she said. \"He will be relieved.\"\n\nBut Cameron said he wanted Conservative MPs doing their job.\n\n\"Obviously Nadine and I have had a few run-ins over the years but I think the chief whip has done the right thing.\"\n\nWhile fellow elected MPs prepared for a normal working day on Thursday, a topless Dorries was photographed sunbathing in Queensland as she relaxed before the programme goes on air this weekend.\n\nThe show, which will run daily, typically involves gruelling challenges, including \"bushtucker trial\" meals which have in the past featured bugs, crocodile penis and kangaroo testicles.\n\nThe parliamentary commissioner for standards, John Lyon, will examine a complaint received about whether she may have breached the code of conduct for MPs by being absent from the Commons.\n\nA spokeswoman for the commissioner confirmed a complaint had been lodged on Wednesday. \"The complaint is being considered in the usual way. We usually respond within five working days,\" she said.\n\nThe Conservative cabinet minister Jeremy Hunt admitted that Dorries's decision to take time out of her job to take part in the programme was causing great concern among colleagues.\n\nThe health secretary told ITV1's Daybreak: \"A lot of people are very worried about it. And I think we want MPs where they should be, voting in the House of Commons.\"\n\nWhen Dorries returns to the UK, she will be summoned to meet Young to discuss whether she will have the party whip restored.\n\nDorries remains blissfully cut off from the furore as she and other participants, who include the EastEnders actor Charlie Brooks and former world darts champion Eric Bristow, are in \"lockdown\" before the show, meaning they are barred from any communication with the outside world.\n\nDr Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative MP for Totnes, has said Dorries, who is paid an annual Commons salary of £65,738, should resign her seat if she wants to be a celebrity and should hand her appearance fee to the taxpayer. Michael Fabricant, the Tory MP for Lichfield, said Dorries had \"let down her colleagues and her constituency\".\n\nBut Dorries claimed in the press material for the show that her appearance was the perfect opportunity to prove that politicians were \"normal\".\n\n\"A lot of people don't vote and if they can see I am a normal mother who comes from a poor background and who didn't go to a posh school, they may think they can be a politician too.

And it was confirmed yesterday that she is being investigated by the Parliamentary Standards Officer over claims she may have breached the MPs’ Code of Conduct.\n\nMrs Dorries, 55, could be away from the House of Commons for up to a month but is still drawing her £65,738 MP’s salary, while being paid up to £40,000 by ITV.\n\nAstonishingly, the Mid-Bedfordshire MP justified her appearance on the show by saying she ‘mostly works seven days a week’ and ministers are often out of the country.\n\nIn an interview given before she left Britain, she claimed neighbouring MP Alistair Burt frequently travelled abroad without criticism in his role as a foreign minister.\n\nMrs Dorries – who has been pictured sunbathing topless during a pre-show stay at a luxury hotel – said: ‘In his ministerial role he has had 20 weeks abroad this year. \n\n\n\nBut do they say when he is in Qatar for weeks that he is neglecting his constituency?’ \n\n\n\nShe claimed her constituents would understand why she has gone on the show. \n\n\n\nLast night in Brussels, Mr Burt, the MP for North East Bedfordshire, said: ‘I am surprised Nadine believes there is some similarity between me being abroad on behalf of the British people, including my constituents, and her taking part in a TV show in the jungle.’\n\nThe show’s producers are understood to have told Mrs Dorries that she has been suspended by her party but sources in Australia say she has apparently decided to press ahead with her appearance on the show.\n\nAn update to her 12,000 followers on twitter read: 'Hello! I can confirm Nadine Dorries MP is in the jungle! I (her daughter) will be covering her Twitter in the meantime!'\n\nIt is thought the tweets are being posted by Ms Dorries daughter Cassie.\n\nIt also emerged today that Ms Dorries could be investigated over the revelations she kept another daughter, Philippa, on the public payroll as a parliamentary aide even after she had joined a major law firm as a full-time trainee.\n\nPhilippa is listed on the register of MPs' interests as an 'Office Manager/Executive Secretary' in her mother's office, despite joining Mischon De Reya in August. Ms Dorries agent insisted Philippa stopped working for her mum in August and the record had not been updated.\n\nEarlier this year Philippa was revealed to be dating Tory MP Chris Kelly.\n\nSpeculation has grown that Mrs Dorries could defect to UKIP after she emerges from the jungle.\n\nBookies Ladbrokes slashed the odds that she would jump ship, making it just 2/1 that Mrs Dorries would join UKIP before the next election and 5/1 that she would leave she leaves politics for good.\n\nUKIP leader Nigel Farage tried the play down an imminent defection, saying: ‘I haven’t had an application, she is in the jungle for a month.’\n\nHe added: ‘I wish her well with the creepy crawlies in the jungle as opposed to the creepy crawlies in Westminster.’ \n\n\n\nMr Farage said the Conservative party had gone too far in suspending Mrs Dorries: ‘If one of my MEPs who was not a frontbench spokesman decided to go into the jungle, I would see it as an opportunity to reach an audience of 16 million.’\n\nUKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom said he would delighted if Mrs Dorries eventually joined UKIP. ‘We like her, she is feisty and has balls.’ He added: ‘I’m not sure this jungle thing is a good idea, I’d rather she came straight to us. \n\n\n\n'But reality TV did not seem to harm George Galloway when he won Bradford. It doesn’t seem to matter what one does these days, it makes you wonder what you have to do to not get elected.’\n\nMs Dorries was suspended by the Tory party after jetting out to Australia without telling the Prime Minister what she was up to. Breaking her silence since arriving in Australia, the 55-year-old revealed her fears about missing her daughters, not being able to drink coffee and not knowing who won the US election. \n\n\n\nBut she could not resist one last swipe at the Eton-educated PM, declaring: ‘I do not like arrogant people who think they are born to rule.’\n\nShe said: 'I am the first politician to go on I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here!\n\n'A lot of people don’t vote and if they can see I am a normal mother who comes from a poor background and who didn’t go to a posh school, they may think they can be a politician too. Maybe they will trust us more.\n\n'I know there will be a backlash that I am going on this show, but I would like to point out that I have never before taken a week away in Parliamentary time whereas a lot of other MPs have.'\n\n\n\nThe 55-year-old triggered a political storm when she jetted off to Australia without telling Mr Cameron, party whips or even her local activists.\n\nBut she said she thought the PM would be pleased to have her out of the way: 'I am a thorn in his side. He will be relieved.'\n\nMr Cameron has distanced himself from the suspension of errant MP Nadine Dorries from the Conservative Party over her appearance in the Australian jungle.\n\nThe Prime Minister made clear the decision to suspend the Mid-Bedforshire MP over her unsanctioned appearance in I’m A Celebrity was made by the chief whip, Sir George Young.\n\nWhen news broke of her decision to sign up for the show and its famous ‘bushtucker trials’, Mr Cameron’s aides had suggested that if she wanted to make a fool of herself on national television, it was up to her.\n\nBut as fellow MPs reacted with fury to Ms Dorries, they were quickly briefing that Mr Cameron had decided she should be reprimanded.\n\nIn another change of tone, Mr Cameron did nothing to claim the credit yesterday.\n\nIn his first comments on the affair, he said at the close of his visit to the Middle East: ‘I think the Chief Whip has made the right decision, he’s responsible for these things. I think it was well made, well explained and he’s done the right thing.’\n\nThe change of heart suggests the premier does not want to be seen to have over-reacted to a woman who once described Mr Cameron and the Chancellor as ‘two arrogant posh boys’.\n\nBut a poll of 5,500 people for AOL.com showed the public was overwhelmingly behind the decision to suspend Mrs Dorries. Some 86 per cent backed the action, while just ten per cent thought the Tory party was wrong to suspend her.\n\nLouise Mensch - the outgoing Tory MP for Corby who stood down last month to spend more time with her rock band manager husband in America - accused Mrs Dorries of ‘demeaning’ parliament. \n\n\n\nMrs Mensch added: ‘Celebrity is fleeting; laws actually matter. I envy and honour my former colleagues, on all sides, who are still making them.’\n\nOther senior politicians also poked fun at Mrs Dorries during Prime Minister’s Questions.\n\nNick Clegg, standing in for Mr Cameron, said: ‘When I heard she had been sent to the jungle to eat insects, I thought that despite the appearance of civility from our new chief whip, this indicated a new disciplinarian approach in our whips’ office,’ he said.\n\nLabour deputy leader Harriet Harman added: 'I am beginning to have quite a lot of sympathy with (Ms Dorries). All those rats and snakes... and that’s before she went to the jungle.’\n\nBut former Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik, who has also been on the show, tweeted: ‘Pls back Nadine Dorries - victim of witch hunt by her party, and ‘on trial’ with no opportunity to even know she’s been suspended.’", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:09:35.153-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:09:35.153-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/nov/07/nadine-dorries-celebrity-david-cameron", "title" : "Nadine Dorries says I'm a Celebrity trip will be a relief for David Cameron", "text" : "Nadine Dorries, the MP suspended by the Conservative party after flying out to Australia to take part in I'm a Celebrity … Get Me Out Of Here, has claimed David Cameron will be \"relieved\" she is out in the jungle rather than doing her job.\n\nThe MP for Mid Bedfordshire, who is paid an annual Commons salary of £65,738, rightly predicted there would be a backlash, in comments released in an ITV press release on Wednesday confirming the show's lineup.\n\nShe has been in lockdown for the past couple of days, according to ITV, and is unlikely to be aware of the furore her decision has caused. She claimed the prime minister would be glad to see the back of her. \"I am a thorn in his side. He will be relieved,\" she said.\n\nDorries did not tell fellow politicians or the Tory chief whip, Sir George Young, about her plan to take part in the programme, which starts on Sunday and could keep her out of circulation for up to a month.\n\nIn the press release, Dorries said that unlike \"a lot of other MPs\" she had never before taken a week away in parliamentary time. The show was the perfect opportunity to prove that politicians are \"normal\", she said.\n\n\"A lot of people don't vote and if they can see I am a normal mother who comes from a poor background and who didn't go to a posh school, they may think they can be a politician too. Maybe they will trust us more.\"\n\nShe said she had never watched the programme and had no gameplan. Life in Westminster and the skills she had learned to survive as a female MP would help her over the next few weeks, she said. \"Westminster is a jungle. Game-playing, tactics, strategies. In Westminster you achieve everything by vote. This is the same. The parallels are huge.\"\n\nThe former Conservative minister Ann Widdecombe, who took part in Celebrity Fit Club while a backbench MP and appeared on Strictly Come Dancing after retiring from politics in 2010, said the decision to suspend Dorries was \"loony\".\n\nIn a newspaper article on Wednesday, she said Dorries could lose face and become a figure of fun. But she said Young's decision made Tory whips look heavy-handed and could backfire if the MP proved popular with viewers.\n\n\"If Nadine does get it right out there, they have got themselves into a very silly situation,\" Widdecombe told BBC Radio 4's PM. \"Why on earth couldn't they have said it is a matter between Dorries and her constituents and left it at that? Silly, silly idiots.\"\n\nIn the press material Dorries lists her phobias as rats and mice. With contestants on the show cut off from all communication with the outside world, she listed the \"special occasions\" she would miss while in the jungle as \"local elections, a by-election, whether President Obama will still be in office or not, and the Tatler ball\".\n\nAsked whether her decision to appear on the programme was part of a new career in television, Dorries said: \"I really don't know. I am not going to look to the future. I just want to see what happens.\"\n\nDorries was the butt of MPs' jokes in the Commons as they mocked her decision to take part. Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister, standing in for Cameron at prime minister's question time, quipped: \"When I heard [Dorries] had been sent to the jungle to eat insects, I thought that despite the appearance of civility from our new chief whip this indicated a new disciplinarian approach in our whips' office.\"\n\nBut Dorries's decision was no laughing matter for her constituency association, whose executive is due to meet this week to discuss the implications of of her losing the Tory whip. Budge Wells, a Conservative councillor and deputy chair of the Mid Bedfordshire Conservative Association, aired concerns that Dorries was engaged in \"triviality\".\n\n\"We will consider what not having a Conservative MP for the interim period means to us,\" he said. \"I do not want to pre-empt what the executive will say, but currently we are very concerned indeed about the press reports highlighting the triviality of what the MP is doing.\"", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:09:37.697-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:09:37.697-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/07/nadine-dorries-celebrity-mp", "title" : "Louise Mensch: Nadine Dorries has demeaned the role of an MP", "text" : "Mid-Bedfordshire is a safe Conservative seat. Barring some disaster, an MP can expect to occupy such a berth for their entire career. Until yesterday, Nadine Dorries had that chance. And yet she decided to fly to Australia instead, to appear on the reality TV show I'm a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here.\n\nWhen I resigned as an MP, it was because I could not make family life work with my husband on another continent. We were also told that children adjust more easily the earlier they move. I would infinitely have preferred to have seen out my term, but it was not to be; and that it is something I will regret for the rest of my life. But not in a million years would I have agreed to go on a reality TV show.\n\nUpon hearing the news, Tory MPs on Twitter were unusually frank. MPs Andrew Griffiths, Sarah Wollaston, Claire Perry and Michael Fabricant all went on the record. \"I'm not fit to be an MP – kick me out of here,\" said Perry. \"She has let down her colleagues,\" said Fabricant. \"#betteroffout,\" said Griffiths, perhaps presciently employing the Ukip hashtag.\n\nCommentators were quick to underline the fact that Dorries's constituents would go unrepresented for a month, and what a scandal that was. It isn't quite that simple. Gordon Brown is rarely in the Commons, yet he does not get lambasted for it (much). More to the point is the demeaning of the role of an MP, as well as the secrecy that surrounded her decision (it would appear from an interview with the chairman of the Mid-Bedfordshire Conservative Association that Dorries had not spoken to him at all; the whips were similarly kept in the dark). She made her choice, preferring the cameras to weeks of parliamentary votes, skipping out on the autumn statement – a crucial piece of government business – in the process.\n\nAs a seasoned media performer, Dorries knows how to work a message. She must have had some idea how unpopular this move would be. The TV show gig is paid – £40,000 in her case – and perks such as, say, a business-class flight to Australia would all have to be declared in the register of members' interests. So to justify her choice, she fell back on a populist argument: \"I'm doing the show because 16million people watch it,\" she said. \"If people are watching I'm a Celebrity, that is where MPs should be going.\" She added that she was also doing it to raise awareness of her pro-life views.\n\nIt is true that more people watch I'm a Celebrity than PMQs. But they also expect their politicians to do more than appear on gameshows. Eating grubs and performing humiliating tasks on air are not consistent with being an MP – unless you're retired, or desperate. But no matter: on Monday, Dorries was talking to the Mirror about packing her bikini. The Conservatives acted with appropriate speed in suspending the whip, pending an \"interview without coffee\" with the chief whip. I was rather surprised that the whip was not simply withdrawn.\n\nSpeaking as a moderate pro-lifer myself, it was the shabby excuse of using the platform to highlight her views on abortion that was the worst thing of all. If it's about \"life\", then donate the £40,000 to adoption charities. Nadine never forgave me for trying to introduce a moderate, alternative amendment to her own on counselling, which would have meant abortion providers were banned from offering counselling to women undecided as to their choice. I sought to introduce an amendment protecting those providers but adding independent counselling, principally on the NHS, as an alternative. Dorries never understood that in a pro-choice country, pro-life goals can only be achieved in pro-choice ways. She failed, and the movement will make no gains whatsoever while she is allowed to remain its spokeswoman.\n\nFrom the safety of her seat, Dorries was always criticising the party leadership and other MPs. Just before crucial local elections, she said David Cameron and George Osborne were \"two arrogant posh boys who show no remorse, no contrition, and no passion to want to understand the lives of others – and that is their real crime\". This was a breathtaking way to talk about our prime minister, who has lived with tragedy and suffering that she cannot begin to imagine. You might dislike the prime minister's policies – and that's fine – but he and the chancellor are two very likeable and good men, as well as politicians that care deeply about others, and their colleagues know it. Her outburst led the news for days, after which many hardworking Tory councillors in marginal seats lost the wards they had worked for.\n\nDorries also said of the non-elected (and hence non-responsible to anybody) Speaker's wife, Sally Bercow, that she had made her husband and his office a \"laughing stock\" after a frank interview by Bercow with the London Evening Standard. And so forth, and so on. This does not engender loyalty in return.\n\nThere is, however, one positive thing about the whole affair. In the future, we will see fewer politicians thinking of George Galloway – or Dorries-esque ways to boost their \"profile\". Celebrity is fleeting; laws actually matter.

I think it just makes her look ridiculous and it brings politics into disrepute.\"\n\nPaul Duckett, chairman of the Mid-Bedforshire Conservative association, said members may consider sacking Ms Dorries over her appearance on the show, adding that he had only learned about Ms Dorries appearance when media arrived in the constituency on Tuesday morning.\n\nMr Duckett said Ms Dorries was a hard-working MP but the appearance might \"detract from the gravitas\" of her role.\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron - who has publicly clashed with Ms Dorries in the past - earlier refused to be drawn into the row, saying: \"Nadine Dorries can speak for herself on this issue.\"\n\nRelations between No 10 and Ms Dorries, a former nurse, have been strained since the prime minister made a joke at her expense in the Commons, describing her as \"frustrated\". He subsequently apologised.\n\nMs Dorries grabbed headlines by describing Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne as \"two arrogant posh boys\" who were out of touch with the real world.\n\nFormer Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik, who took part in I'm a Celebrity in 2010 after losing his seat, told the BBC the Conservative leadership was \"out of touch with the zeitgeist of the nation\".\n\nHe added: \"I'm outraged by the fact that it thinks she's been wrong to do something that can put politics in touch with the public.\"\n\nBut former Tory MP Louise Mensch, who recently resigned from the Commons for family reasons and who has had a well-publicised spat with Ms Dorries over her decision, tweeted: \"Nothing sadder than a politician, or ex-politician, on any of those shows.\"\n\nLabour MP Steve McCabe said: \"David Cameron was too weak to stop Nadine Dorries appearing on a reality TV show.\n\n\"But even after dithering over what to do all day, by suspending her he's acted more quickly over an MP who called him an 'arrogant posh boy' than he ever did over a chief whip who swore at a police officer.\"\n\nIn February 2010, Ms Dorries took part in the Channel 4 documentary series Tower Block of Commons, in which MPs moved in with benefit claimants on a deprived council estate.\n\nGeorge Galloway, the only other sitting MP to have taken part in a reality game show that took him away from the Commons, when he spent three weeks on Celebrity Big Brother in 2006, also faced criticism that he was neglecting his constituents.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:09:40.002-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:09:40.002-0400" } } ] },{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5414eb0b2c243f649770365d" }, "title" : "BBC Director-General Entwistle resigns", "articles" : [ { "ext_url" : "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20284124", "title" : "George Entwistle resigns as BBC director general", "text" : "The BBC's director general, George Entwistle, has resigned in the wake of the Newsnight child abuse broadcast.\n\nHe said that as the man \"ultimately responsible for all content, and in the light of the unacceptable journalistic standards\" he would quit.\n\nMr Entwistle had admitted Newsnight's report, which led to Thatcher-era Tory Lord McAlpine being wrongly implicated, should not have been aired.\n\nThe broadcast covered cases of child abuse at north Wales care homes.\n\nBBC Trust chairman Lord Patten, who appeared alongside Mr Entwistle when he delivered his statement, will answer questions on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme on Sunday morning.\n\nMr Entwistle took up the post of director general on 17 September, and his sudden resignation makes him the shortest-serving BBC director general.\n\nIn his statement, he said: \"In the light of the fact that the director general is also the editor-in-chief and ultimately responsible for all content, and in the light of the unacceptable journalistic standards of the Newsnight film broadcast on Friday 2 November, I have decided that the honourable thing to do is to step down from the post of director general.\"\n\nHe said that when he was appointed to the role, he was confident BBC trustees had chosen the best candidate for the post and the \"right person to tackle the challenges and opportunities ahead\".\n\n\"However, the wholly exceptional events of the past few weeks have led me to conclude that the BBC should appoint a new leader,\" he said.\n\nContinue reading the main story George Entwistle said he was stepping down because as director general of the BBC he was also its editor in chief. He said it was the honourable thing to do after a BBC Newsnight film alleged child abuse by an unnamed Conservative politician - which was proved to be unfounded. Coming on top of the Jimmy Savile crisis, which was prompted partly by the fact that Newsnight had shelved an earlier investigation into allegations of child abuse, this was particularly damaging to the BBC. But this was also about the handling of the crisis. Last month, Mr Entwistle was accused by MPs of showing \"an extraordinary lack of curiosity\" over the Jimmy Savile affair and they told him to \"get a grip\". On Saturday in an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said he knew nothing in advance about the Newsnight broadcast nor had he seen a newspaper report revealing Lord McAlpine may have been wrongly accused. MPs, former editors and broadcasting executives were unimpressed and so, I understand, were members of the BBC Trust. On Sunday, the job of acting director-general will be taken by Tim Davie, who's been running the radio side of the BBC but who has no direct journalistic experience. The BBC still faces very serious questions, not just about its journalism but about how the organisation is run. This crisis - one of the most serious in the BBC's history - is not yet over.\n\n\"To have been the director general of the BBC even for a short period, and in the most challenging of circumstances, has been a great honour.\n\n\"We must not lose sight of the fact that the BBC is full of people of the greatest talent and the highest integrity.\n\n\"That's what will continue to make it the finest broadcaster in the world.\"\n\nLater, speaking outside his home following his resignation, Mr Entwistle said he was going to \"spend some time with my family\".\n\nDuring his 54 days in charge, Mr Entwistle has also had to deal with controversy over the BBC shelving a Newsnight investigation into former BBC presenter and DJ Jimmy Savile, who police say could have abused as many as 300 people over a 40-year-period.\n\nAs a result, an inquiry is examining whether there were BBC management failings surrounding the Newsnight's Savile programme not being broadcast, and another inquiry has begun into the culture and practices at the BBC in the era of alleged sexual abuse by Savile. Another review is to examine sexual harassment policies at the BBC.\n\nMr Entwistle's resignation came after he was criticised for his performance during an interview on the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme on Saturday, in which he admitted he had not read a newspaper article revealing the case of mistaken identity involving Lord McAlpine, and that he had not seen the Newsnight broadcast when it aired on 2 November as he \"was out\".\n\nLord Patten said: \"This is undoubtedly one of the saddest evenings of my public life.\"\n\nHe added: \"At the heart of the BBC is its role as a trusted global news organisation.\n\n\"As the editor in chief of that news organisation George has very honourably offered us his resignation because of the unacceptable mistakes - the unacceptable shoddy journalism - which has caused us so much controversy.\n\n\"He has behaved as editor with huge honour and courage and would that the rest of the world always behaved the same.\"\n\nCulture Secretary Maria Miller said: \"It is a regrettable, but right decision. It is vital that credibility and public trust in this important national institution is restored.\n\n\"It is now crucial that the BBC puts the systems in place to ensure it can make first-class news and current affairs programmes.\"\n\nBut Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, who sits on the culture select committee, said Mr Entwistle's departure was a \"terrible mistake\" and that he had been \"hung out to dry\".\n\nHe described Mr Entwistle as \"an honourable, highly talented, very very good man who is trying to do the right thing\".\n\n\"George Entwistle has been badly let down by BBC News managers and the people around him. He was trying to get to grips with that. The BBC should have given him time.\"\n\nConservative MP Philip Davies, who also sits on the culture select committee, said Lord Patten should resign. \"He is responsible for the public's trust in the BBC,\" Mr Davies told the BBC. \"That trust is at an all time low.\"\n\nTim Davie, director of BBC Audio and Music, will take over as acting director general immediately.\n\nBBC home editor Mark Easton said the BBC was at a \"real crossroads, because its whole future depends on convincing the public in the United Kingdom that this is an organisation in which they have confidence, and in which they have trust, and that they believe in the integrity of our news coverage\".\n\n\"He has been brought low by cowards and incompetents.\"\n\nNewsnight reported on 2 November abuse victim Steve Messham's claims against a leading 1980s Tory politician, but he withdrew his accusation a week later, saying he had been mistaken.\n\nLord McAlpine, although not named on Newsnight, was identified on the internet as the subject of the allegations.\n\nMr Messham apologised to Lord McAlpine saying he was not the man who assaulted him, while Lord McAlpine said the claims were \"wholly false and seriously defamatory\".\n\nThe BBC has ordered an \"immediate pause\" in Newsnight investigations to assess editorial robustness and a suspension of all co-productions with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which worked on the Newsnight broadcast.\n\nBefore his departure, Mr Entwistle had commissioned a report from BBC Scotland director Ken MacQuarrie into what happened with the Newsnight investigation.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:10:33.498-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:10:33.498-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.channel4.com/news/george-entwistle-resigns-as-bbc-director-general", "title" : "George Entwistle resigns as BBC director-general", "text" : "Mr Entwistle, speaking alongside BBC Trust Chairman Lord Patten, said: \"I have decided that the honorable thing to do is to step down.\"\n\nLast week an edition of BBC Newsnight incorrectly implicated Lord McAlpine, a former Conservative party chairman, in the abuse scandal at the Bryn Estyn children's home in north Wales - although not identifying the Tory peer by name.\n\nThe BBC subsequently issued an unreserved apology after Steve Messham, one of the victims interviewed by Newsnight, admitted he had wrongly identified Lord McAlpine as the man who abused him in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nMr Entwistle said in a statement outside Broadcasting House on Saturday night: \"When appointed to the role, with 23 years' experience as a producer and leader at the BBC, I was confident the trustees had chosen the best candidate for the post, and the right person to tackle the challenges and opportunities ahead,\" he said.\n\n\"However the wholly exceptional events of the past few weeks have led me to conclude that the BBC should appoint a new leader.\"", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:10:34.802-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:10:34.802-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.channel4.com/news/top-tory-links-to-abuse-could-be-mistaken", "title" : "Top Tory links to abuse could be mistaken", "text" : "Lord Alistair McAlpine has been at the centre of allegations of abuse at a children's care home in north Wales, following claims made by Steve Messham, a former resident of the Wrexham care home at the centre of the allegations.\n\nMr Messham told BBC Newsnight that he had been abused by a former Tory aide more than a dozen times, but the programme did not name the accused.\n\nBut now a local councillor who was also a victim of abuse at the Bryn Estyn care home has told the Guardian he did not believe Lord McAlpine was involved.\n\nThe new evidence came as David Cameron warned of a \"witch-hunt\" on Thursday, after he was confronted with a list of suspected paedophiles live on television.\n\nMcAlpine has vehemently denied the allegations made against him, pointing out that he had only been to Wrexham once in his life and lived miles away in the south of England at the time.\n\nOn Thursday Keith Gregory, the Wrexham councillor who acted as spokesperson for the victims of abuse since the allegations of abuse at the home in the 1970s and 1980s emerged again recently, said he believed a different member of the McAlpine family may be responsible instead.

An Israeli firefighter extinguishes a burning car after a rocket fired by Palestinian militants in Gaza landed in the southern city of Beersheba November 14, 2012. Israel launched a major offensive against Palestinian militants in Gaza on Wednesday, killing the military commander of Hamas in an air strike and threatening an invasion of the enclave that the Islamist group vowed would 'open the gates of hell'.\n\nThe onslaught shattered hopes that a truce mediated on Tuesday by Egypt could pull the two sides back from the brink of war after five days of escalating Palestinian rocket attacks and Israeli strikes at militant targets.\n\nOperation \"Pillar of Defence\" began with a surgical strike on a car carrying the commander of the military wing of Hamas, the Iranian-armed Islamist movement which controls Gaza and dominates a score of smaller armed groups.\n\nWithin minutes of the death of Ahmed Al-Jaabari, big explosions shook Gaza as the Israeli air force struck at selected targets just before sundown, blasting plumes of smoke and debris high above the crowded city.\n\nPanicking civilians ran for cover and the death toll mounted quickly. Ten people including three children were killed, the health ministry said, and about 40 were wounded. Also among the dead were an 11-month-old baby and a woman pregnant with twins.\n\nArmy tanks shelled border areas of Gaza in south and the Israeli navy shelled a Hamas security position from the sea.\n\nHamas stuck back, firing at least four Grad rockets at the southern city of Beersheba in what it called its initial response. Israel reported damage but no casualties. Its 'Iron Dome' interceptor defence knocked out a dozen rockets in flight.\n\nThe escalation in Gaza came in a week when Israel fired at Syrian artillery positions it said had fired into the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights amid a civil war in Syria that has brought renewed instability to neighboring Lebanon.\n\nEgypt, whose new Islamist government pledged to honor the 1979 peace treaty with Israel, condemned the raids as a threat to regional security, recalled its ambassador from Israel and called for an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council.\n\nEgyptian President Mohamed Mursi's predecessor Hosni Mubarak twice withdrew his ambassador, with no lasting effect. But Israel will be watching for signs of a more aggressive approach by the Islamist leader that could imperil their ties.\n\nMursi has said of the Palestinians that \"our blood is their blood\" and Egypt may not \"accept what was accepted before\".\n\nRussia called for an end to the raids. Arab League foreign ministers planned to meet on Saturday to discuss the crisis.\n\nA second Gaza war has loomed on the horizon for months as waves of Palestinian rocket attacks and Israeli strikes grew increasingly more intense and frequent.\n\nIsrael's Operation Cast Lead in 2008-2009 began with a week of air attacks and shelling, followed by a land invasion of the blockaded coastal strip, sealed off at sea by the Israeli navy. Some 1,400 Palestinians were killed and 13 Israelis died.\n\nThe Israel Defence Forces said it had targeted dozens of Hamas's medium range (up to 40km) underground rocket launch and infrastructure sites in Wednesday's strikes.\n\n\"This has significantly damaged the rocket launch capabilities as munitions warehouses owned by Hamas and other terror organizations were targeted. In addition, Israeli Navy soldiers targeted several Hamas terror sites stationed along the shoreline of the Gaza Strip,\" it said in a statement.\n\nThe Hamas internal security headquarters in southern Gaza was destroyed. There were no injuries because it had been evacuated. After dark, Gaza looked like a ghost city, with no traffic and no people in the streets, no shops open, no electric lights on.\n\nHamas said Jaabari, who ran the organization's armed wing, Izz el-Deen Al-Qassam, died along with a Hamas photographer when their car was blown apart by an Israeli missile.\n\nThe charred wreckage of a car could be seen belching flames, as emergency crews picked up what appeared to be body parts.\n\nIsrael confirmed it had carried out the attack and announced there was more to come. Reuters witnesses saw Hamas security compounds and police stations blasted apart.\n\n\"Today we relayed a clear message to the Hamas organization and other terrorist organizations,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. \"And if there is a need, the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) is prepared to broaden the operation. We will continue to do everything in order to protect our citizens.\"\n\nImmediate calls for revenge were broadcast over Hamas radio.\n\n\"The occupation has opened the gates of hell,\" Hamas's armed wing said. Smaller groups also vowed to strike back.\n\n\"Israel has declared war on Gaza and they will bear the responsibility for the consequences,\" Islamic Jihad said.\n\nSouthern Israeli communities within rocket range of Gaza were on full alert, and schools were ordered closed for Thursday. About one million Israelis live in range of Gaza's relatively primitive but lethal rockets, supplemented in recent months by longer-range, more accurate systems.\n\n\"The days we face in the south will, in my estimation, prove protracted,\" Brigadier-General Yoav Mordechai, Israel's chief military spokesman, told Channel 2 TV.\n\nThe Israeli cabinet gave preliminary authorization for the mobilization of military reserves if required, Netanyahu's office said.\n\nAsked if Israel might send in ground forces, Mordechai said: \"There are preparations, and if we are required to, the option of an entry by ground is available.\"\n\nIsraeli President Shimon Peres briefed U.S. President Barack Obama on the operation, Peres's office said. He told Obama that Jaabari was a \"mass-murderer\" and his killing was Israel's response to Palestinian rocket attacks from Gaza.\n\n\"Israel is not interested in stoking the flames, but for the past five days there has been constant missile fire at Israel and mothers and children cannot sleep quietly at night,\" said Peres, who visited the border town of Sderot earlier.\n\nIn the flare-up that was prelude to Wednesday's offensive, more than 115 missiles were fired into southern Israel from Gaza and Israeli planes launched numerous strikes.\n\nSeven Palestinians, three of them gunmen, were killed. Eight Israeli civilians were hurt by rocket fire and four soldiers wounded by an anti-tank missile.\n\nThe leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Ismail Haniyeh, called on Arab states, especially Egypt, to halt the assault. The six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council said the U.N. Security Council should put pressure on Israel to stop its attacks.\n\nIsrael holds a general election on January 22 and Netanyahu has pledged to retaliate harshly against Hamas. But Israel is also wary of the reaction from Mursi's Egypt, whose ruling Muslim Brotherhood is the spiritual mentor of Hamas.\n\nHamas has been emboldened by its rise to power, viewing Mursi as a \"safety net\" who will not permit a second Israeli thrashing of Gaza, home to 1.7 million Palestinians.\n\nHamas is also supported by Iran, which Israel regards as a rising threat to its own existence due to its nuclear program.\n\nHelped by the contraband trade through tunnels from Egypt, Gaza militias have smuggled in longer-range rockets.\n\nBut their estimated 35,000 Palestinian fighters are still no match for Israel's F-16 fighter-bombers, Apache helicopter gun ships, Merkava tanks and other modern weapons systems in the hands of a conscript force of 175,000, with 450,000 in reserve.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:10:41.243-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-13T21:10:41.243-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://blogs.aljazeera.com/topic/gaza/avital-leibovich-says-all-options-are-table-far-israel-concerned", "title" : "Avital Leibovich says 'all options are on the table' as far as Israel is concerned", "text" : "Avital Leibovich, Israeli military spokesperson, confirmed to Al Jazeera that Ahmad Jabari was targeted specifically.\n\n\"The first target we targeted was Ahmad Jabari.

He apparently survived. The Palestinians reported that Israel attacked another top terrorist, but they did not release his name or say if he was killed in the strike.\n\nMeanwhile, the IDF has decided to deploy additional infantry units in the south ahead of a possible ground offensive in Gaza. In addition, large IDF exercises have been halted and reserve soldiers have been called up.\n\nIsrael's Shin Bet domestic intelligence service confirmed it had carried out the attack on Jabari with the Air Force because of his \"decade-long terrorist activity.\"\n\nNews agencies reported of additional attacks throughout Gaza. According to the reports, one of the strikes injured another senior Hamas commander.\n\nAt around 5 pm, shortly after the hit in Gaza, at least two rockets were fired toward the Ashkelon Beach Regional Council.

Ahmad Jabari, the operational commander of Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, was killed on Wednesday alongside his bodyguard, Mohammed al-Hams, in an initial Israeli strike on a car in Gaza City which took place just before 4:00pm (14:00GMT), the Palestinian movement said. Shortly afterwards, Israel pounded the Gaza Strip with another 20 air strikes, killing five more people, two of them children, Hamas health minister Mufid Mukhalalati said in a televised press conference at Gaza City's Shifa hospital. He said another 30 people had been injured in the wave of strikes on targets across the territory which hit Gaza City, the northern town of Beit Lahiya and the southern city of Khan Yunis. \"The Israeli occupation has carried out more than 20 air strikes on targets and headquarters of the police and security in the Gaza Strip,\" interior ministry spokesman Islam Shahwan said. The attacks on Wednesday marked the biggest escalation between Israel and Gaza fighters since the 2008-2009 conflict and came despite signs on Tuesday that neighbouring Egypt had managed to broker a truce in the territory after a five-day surge of violence. Israel's military confirmed the operation, saying: \"Jabari \"was a senior Hamas operative... directly responsible for executing terror attacks against the State of Israel in the past number of years. \"The purpose of this operation was to severely impair the command and control chain of the Hamas leadership, as well as its terrorist infrastructure,\" it said in a statement. Israel sent a \"clear message\" to Hamas through the killing of its top military commander and is ready to \"expand\" its operation in Gaza if necessary, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said. \"Today we sent a clear message to Hamas and other terrorist organisations, and if it becomes necessary we are prepared to expand the operation,\" he said in a televised address. Military spokeswoman Avital Leibovich said the strike was the start of an operation targeting armed groups in Gaza following multiple rocket attacks on southern Israel. Leibovich confirmed to Al Jazeera that Jabari was targeted specifically. \"The first target we targeted was Ahmad Jabari. A short time ago we completed another phase in the operation which included 20 different targets of rocket launcher pads,\" she said. \"Israel is exercising its right to protect itself, and Jabari has a lot of Israeli blood on his hands.\" She went on to say that \"there are 1.5 million people in Gaza, and even though we were targeted on a daily basis, we still helped Gazans in our hospitals because we are humanitarian people.\" Asked whether Israel was ready to initiate a ground operation in Gaza, Leibovich said: \"All options are on the table for us. We will do whatever necessary to protect the people of Israel.\" Responding to the killing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades said its fighters would \"continue the path of resistance\". \"The occupation has opened the gates of hell on itself,\" it said in a statement. Al Jazeera's Nadim Baba, reporting from Gaza, said Israeli strikes were still going on into Wednesday evening. \"We have been hearing of strikes in different areas of the Gaza Strip,\" he said. \"For the civilian population here it is a very worrying time. People have deserted the streets, and it is very quiet and very tense.\" He added that eye witnesses have reported seeing the Israeli navy off the coast of Gaza, further increasing their concerns. Jabari co-ordinated much of Hamas's military capability, its military strategy, and the transformation of the military wing. He also led the final negotiations in Cairo that concluded the prisoner swap between Hamas and Israel in 2011. The killing of Jabari sparked furious protests in Gaza City, with hundreds of members of Hamas and the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades chanting for revenge inside Shifa hospital. Outside, armed men fired weapons into the air, and mosques throughout the city called prayers to mourn the commander's death. Osama Hamdan, a Hamas representative talking to Al Jazeera in Doha, said: \"we will respond [to the assassination], this I have to say clearly.\" \"The Israelis are working to target the local leaders and political leaders in Gaza. We are expecting acts and reactions from the Palestinians.\" Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian negotiator based in the West Bank, condemned the killing. \"We are witnessing a major escalation against our people in Gaza, and it seems to me the Israeli agenda is war, not truce or a ceasefire,\" he told Al Jazeera. We hold the Israeli government responsible.\" Al Jazeera’s Rula Amin, reporting from Beirut, Lebanon, said Jabari had been a target for Israel for a long time. \"This is a big loss for Hamas, and a success for Israel, who have been after him for a while.\" she said. “We will see an escalation for sure within the immediate future.” “People in Gaza know him. He was considered very smart, very shrewd, considered to be a hero because he had managed until now to escape numerous assassination attempts by Israel.” “People will be bracing for more violence, not just against Hamas but against the civilians too.” Wednesday's attacks come after several days worth of Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip, leaving at least seven Palestinians dead and several more wounded. The strikes started after Palestinians fired an anti-tank missile at an Israeli jeep on Saturday, wounding four soldiers.

Some of the recent news reports appearing on the Internet are making statements like this:\n\n \n\n \"Chimney Rock is of particular importance to local tribes, as the site was home to the ancestors of the modern Pueblo Indians. It was a destination because every 18.6 years, the moon rises exactly between two rock towers — a phenomenon known as a 'lunar standstill.' \" According to the National Trust for Historic Preservation (NTHP), \"the area is the most culturally significant land managed by the U.S. Forest Service.\" Curiously, however, I've not heard of any Indian tribe ever investing time or money into the site; the site (which has been a National Historic Site since 1970) is maintained largely by non-Indian volunteers belonging to the non-profit Chimney Rock Interpretive Association, which also handles summertime tours of the site.\n\n \n\n The president has the authority to establish national monuments under the 1906 Antiquities Act to protect places of \"historic or scientific interest.\" In total, 16 out of 19 presidents have used the act to establish national monuments, including places like the Grand Canyon and the Statue of Liberty.\n\n \n\n According to writer Jessica Goad, from the Center for American Progress Action Fund, \"Protecting places like Chimney Rock isn’t just about history — it’s also about the economy by supporting jobs through the varied economic impacts of tourism. A study commissioned by the National Trust for Historic Preservation found that making Chimney Rock a national monument will double the amount of visitors to the site from 12,000 to 24,000 people over 5 years, stimulating spending and job growth. It will also double the site’s current economic impacts from $1.2 million to $2.4 million.\"\n\n \n\n The NTHP study — which you can download here — claims that within 5 years of “National Monument” designation, the tourist visits to Chimney Rock will exactly double. So, we have to ask... wouldn’t that increased tourism impact would require a larger budget for maintenance and operations? Again referring to the NTHP study, we read:\n\n \n\n The NTHP cites that Chimney Rock lacks a clear cultural resource preservation mandate and needs additional funding. The organization also believes that national monument designation would bring Chimney Rock additional recognition, resources and protection.\n\n \n\n But the Republican Party line in Washington DC demands that the federal government cut its expenses, unless the expenses are for the U.S. military. The NTHP study, on the other hand, suggests that national monument designation at Chimney Rock will require an increase in federal expenditures to handle the increased visitation. Colorado Congressman Scott Tipton’s authorization bill from last summer — Chimney Rock National Monument Establishment Act (H.R. 2621) — specifically stated that \"no additional funds shall be allocated\" as a result of designation. That bill was passed by the House; the Senate did not reciprocate the favor.\n\n \n\n I have been searching the Internet this morning, attempting to discover if the document President Obama plans to sign today will authorize any money to support the Chimney Rock National Monument. No news reports have mentioned funding for the new monument.\n\n \n\n Western Republicans have proposed to limit or even eliminate the president’s authority to designate new national monuments under the Antiquities Act, claiming that protecting places for future generations \"locks them up\" by preventing their development for fossil fuels and mining. Members of the Republican-only Congressional Western Caucus have claimed that the establishment of new monuments and wilderness areas is \"job-killing.\" Utah Rep. Rob Bishop (R), chairman of the House Subcommittee on National Parks, Forest and Public Lands, even has gone so far as to state claim that \"national monuments and wilderness are not a boon to local economies, but rather a detriment in most scenarios.\"\n\n \n\n Rep. Tipton is also sponsoring House Resolution 817, which would amend the Antiquities Act of 1906 to require an “Act of Congress” before any new national monuments could be created. The chances of HR 817 passing both the House and the Senate are slim, and the chances that President Obama would sign such a law are probably even slimmer.\n\n \n\n In no sense of the word is the federal government a profit-making operation. The current managers of Chimney Rock — the U.S. Forest Service — have never been expected to \"earn enough\" to pay for the operations of the San Juan National Forest.\n\n \n\n But in its well-meaning desire to provide all things to all people, our federal government continues expanding its operations — even when it has become obvious that every new penny of expense creates an additional debt burden on our children. Most of us, in Archuleta County, are angry and frustrated by an ever-growing federal deficit. But what if that increased federal debt might benefit the Archuleta County economy?

But it also had financial troubles.\n\nUnder Sulzberger's tenure, the Times was transformed into a paper with a national scope, sold on both coasts, and at the heart of a diversified, multibillion-dollar media operation that included newspapers, magazines, TV and radio stations, the Times said.\n\n\"Mr. Sulzberger's insistence on independence was shown in his decision in 1971 to publish a secret government history of the Vietnam War known as the Pentagon Papers,\" Times columnist Clyde Haberman wrote in Saturday's obituary. \"It was a defining moment for him and, in the view of many journalists and historians, his finest.\"\n\nThe Nixon administration demanded the Times stop its series of articles on the papers, citing national security, but the newspaper refused on First Amendment grounds. It won its case in the U.S. Supreme Court, in a landmark ruling on press freedom.\n\nSulzberger was also responsible for expanding the newspaper from two sections to four, separating metropolitan and business news and introducing new ones geared toward consumers, the Times said.\n\nThe sections were SportsMonday, Science Times, Living, Home and Weekend. They were a gamble, aimed at attracting new readers and advertisers, but they became an instant success and were widely imitated, the Times said.\n\nA billion-dollar investment in new printing facilities enabled the paper to have a national edition, regional editions, and the daily use of color photos and graphics, according to the Times.\n\n\"Punch,\" as many called him, remained on the board of directors until his retirement in 2001.\n\n\"Punch will be sorely missed by his family and his many friends, but we can take some comfort in the fact that his legacy and his abiding belief in the value of quality news and information will always be with us,\" wrote his son, Arthur Sulzberger, Jr.\n\nPeople we've lost in 2012: The lives they lived", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:26:13.404-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:26:13.404-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/30/us-usa-sulzberger-idUSBRE88S0BX20120930", "title" : "Former NY Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger dies at 86", "text" : "Arthur Ochs Sulzberger is pictured in the New York Times boardroom in New York in this undated handout photo.\n\nSulzberger, whose family bought the Times in 1896, died at his home in Southampton, New York, after a lengthy illness, his family said.\n\nSulzberger, known by his childhood nickname Punch, became publisher of the Times in 1963 and it won 31 Pulitzer Prizes under his leadership.

It has been selling off many of its properties and has not paid a dividend in several years. Its share price also has been slumping.\n\nUnder Sulzberger's stewardship, the New York Times became a sprawling media conglomerate with newspapers throughout the United States, magazines, television, radio and online properties.\n\n\"He was a great champion of the newsroom,\" said Joseph Lelyveld, executive editor of the Times from 1994-2001.\n\n\"I think the editors who had the good luck to serve him always knew on a key issue they could count on his backing if they truly believed it was a matter of great importance to the independence of the paper.\"\n\nThe Times won two important freedom-of-the-press fights during Sulzberger's tenure.\n\nIn 1971, the Times published the Pentagon Papers, a highly classified government history on the Vietnam War that embarrassed the administration of President Richard Nixon, which demanded the Times stop publication of the series on grounds of national security.\n\nThe Times, citing the First Amendment, refused and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the newspaper's favor.\n\n\"He was a mythic figure in our house - the man who defied the orders of the White House and the threat of jail to publish the Pentagon Papers,\" said Andrew Rosenthal, the Times' editorial page editor and son of former Times editor Abe Rosenthal.\n\nThe high court also sided with the newspaper in the Times v. Sullivan, a case that began before Sulzberger took over but was settled in 1964 when he was publisher. The ruling established standards for malice that must be proved in libel cases.\n\n\"Punch, the old Marine captain who never backed down from a fight, was an absolutely fierce defender of the freedom of the press,\" Sulzberger Jr. said.\n\nIn a statement from the White House, President Barack Obama said: \"Over the course of more than 30 years, Arthur helped transform the New York Times and secure its status as one of the most successful and respected newspapers in the world.\"\n\nSulzberger was born in 1926, the youngest of four children of Arthur Hays Sulzberger and Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger. It was his father who coined his nickname \"Punch\" when he created an illustrated book involving Arthur's sister Judith.\n\nAccording to the Times, his father described Arthur as having \"come to play the Punch to Judy's endless show,\" referring to the centuries-old popular British puppet show \"Punch and Judy.\"\n\nSulzberger spent nearly his entire professional life at the Times - he worked briefly for the Milwaukee Journal and served in the U.S. Marine Corps during World War Two and the Korean War. He started as a city staff reporter at the Times, working to become a foreign correspondent in the paper's Paris, Rome and London bureaus.\n\nDespite his pedigree, his appointment to lead the company was not an obvious one, according to Gay Talese's \"The Kingdom and the Power.\" The Times was running under the leadership of Sulzberger's brother-in-law Orvil Dryfoos, who was expected to run the paper through the 1970s.\n\nBut Dryfoos' sudden death left a vacuum at the top.\n\nInitial concerns about Sulzberger's lack of executive experience were quickly set aside: He became the newspaper's youngest leader in its history when he was named publisher at the age of 37.\n\nAccording to the Times, Sulzberger once remarked it was no coincidence that family-owned papers were among the best, quipping, \"Nepotism works.\"", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:26:14.768-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:26:14.768-0400" } } ] },{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5415896b2c243f024fc26b92" }, "title" : "California passes law banning gay-to-straight therapy", "articles" : [ { "ext_url" : "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-news-blog/2012/sep/30/gay-cure-ban-california", "title" : "California banishes controversial 'gay cure' therapies to 'dustbin of quackery'", "text" : "California has become the first state in the US to ban controversial \"gay cure\" therapies from being administered to children and teenagers.\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown, a Democrat, signed the bill into law on Saturday, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nThe bill, sponsored by state senator Ted Lieu, bars mental health providers \"from engaging in sexual orientation change efforts\".\n\nBrown said in a statement provided to the Chronicle:\n\nThis bill bans non-scientific 'therapies' that have driven young people to depression and suicide.

Jerry Brown signed a bill to outlaw them Saturday.\n\nThe bill, SB1172 by Sen. Ted Lieu, D-Torrance (Los Angeles County), bars mental health practitioners from performing so-called reparative therapy, which professional psychological organizations have said may cause harm. Gay rights groups have labeled them dangerous and abusive.\n\n\"This bill bans non-scientific 'therapies' that have driven young people to depression and suicide. These practices have no basis in science or medicine and they will now be relegated to the dustbin of quackery,\" Brown said in a statement to The Chronicle.\n\nBrown approved the ban after the public release of two other lists of bills signed and vetoed earlier Saturday. Lieu's bill is expected to appear on a new list to be released Sunday.\n\nThe signing came as Brown nears his Sunday night deadline to consider legislation on his desk. Among the bills vetoed was one that would have barred public transit agencies like BART from shutting off cell phone service in its stations without a court order.\n\nNational gay rights organizations had been lobbying the governor intensely to sign the therapy ban. The Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights organization, sent Brown a petition with nearly 50,000 signatures urging him to approve the measure.\n\n\"LGBT youth will now be protected from a practice that has not only been debunked as junk science, but has been proven to have drastically negative effects on their well-being. We commend Gov. Brown for putting children first, and call on all states to take California's lead on this issue,\" said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign.\n\nUnder the new law, which will take effect Jan. 1, no mental health provider will be able to provide therapy that seeks \"to change behaviors or gender expressions, or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.\"\n\nMental health professionals who violate the law, which applies to therapy for patients younger than 18, will be subject to discipline by whatever group licenses them.\n\nThe therapy often starts from the premise that a person's childhood and parental upbringing has somehow left that person deficient and thus has led him or her to same-sex attractions. Practitioners often are religious, and gay rights groups have derisively characterized the therapy as an attempt to \"pray away the gay.\"\n\nOther significant actions taken by the governor Saturday came from his vetoes.\n\nBrown rejected a bill that would have stopped BART and other government agencies in the state from shutting down cellular phone networks without obtaining a court order. The bill had sailed through the Legislature with unanimous bipartisan support.\n\nThe measure, SB1160 by Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Pacoima (Los Angeles County), came in response to the controversial decision by BART officials to shut down underground cell service at San Francisco stations in August 2011 in an attempt to disrupt a protest over the killing of a man by a BART police officer.\n\nIn his veto message, the governor wrote that the determinations required by the bill \"must be made by officers engaged in conflict\" and could divert their attention away from quickly and safely resolving the incident.\n\nBrown encouraged Padilla to work with law enforcement agencies to come up with another bill next year that \"balances the protection of free speech with the ability of law enforcement to utilize this tool in the protection of public health and safety.\"\n\nThe governor also vetoed a number of bills that would, in part, have resurrected the redevelopment system used by cities and counties that was eliminated as part of last year's budget debate.\n\n\"This measure would likely cause cities to focus their efforts on using the new tools provided by the measure instead of winding down redevelopment,\" the governor wrote in his veto of AB2144 by Assembly Speaker John Pérez, D-Los Angeles. \"This would prevent the state from achieving the general fund savings assumed in this year's budget.\"\n\nOn Friday, the Department of Finance reported that the state had so far come in significantly below what was anticipated in savings from the statewide elimination of redevelopment agencies, coming up hundreds of millions of dollars short of what was assumed in Brown's budget.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:26:19.404-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:26:19.404-0400" } } ] },{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "5415896d2c243f024fc26b93" }, "title" : "2,200 jobs to be lost as JJB Sports goes into administration", "articles" : [ { "ext_url" : "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19792124", "title" : "JJB Sports in administration with 2,200 job losses", "text" : "About 2,200 staff at JJB Sports are to be made redundant after the sports clothes and equipment retailer was placed into administration.\n\nThe administrators said they had managed to save 550 jobs after selling part of the business to Sports Direct.\n\nJJB's High Street rival is buying the website and 20 of its stores, which will be rebranded Sports Direct.\n\nThe remaining 133 JJB stores are to close immediately, the administrators KPMG said.\n\nThe Wigan-based retailer was hurt by the economic downturn and struggled to compete with Sports Direct.\n\n'Not been enough'\n\nDave Whelan, the current owner of Wigan football club, founded JJB Sports in 1971, before selling it in 2007.

The shares were worth less than a penny when they were suspended.\n\nThere had been hopes that Whelan, a former Blackburn Rovers footballer who is now chairman of Wigan Athletic, would step in to save the stricken company that he founded in 1971 when he turned a Wigan fishing tackle shop, JJ Bradburns, into a sports store. In 1994, the 120-store chain floated on the London Stock Exchange and four years later, the acquisition of Sports Division, its largest competitor at the time, turned it into the largest sports retailer in the UK.\n\nRichard Fleming, UK head of restructuring at KPMG, said: \"Successive attempts to restructure the business, both financially and operationally, have not been enough to prevent the company falling into administration.

Analysts say JJB's management lacked the expertise to keep up with Sports Direct's aggressive expansion and strategy of acquiring brands such as Lonsdale and Dunlop, while JJB's clothing business was also hammered by competition from supermarkets and discount chains such as Primark.\n\nTwo company voluntary arrangements in 2009 and 2011 â legal agreements designed to reduce rent costs for struggling retailers â shrank the store portfolio but failed to save the business. JJB put itself up for sale in August this year after warning it could run out of money. It had been kept afloat thanks to the support of a core group of investors â Invesco, Harris Associates, Crystal Amber and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation â but by then shareholders' patience had worn thin and they refused to pump any more money into the beleaguered retailer.\n\nThe British Property Federation said that landlords had been hit especially hard by JJB's collapse. Liz Peace, the federation's chief executive, said: \"Having played their part in twice saving JJB from administration, taking a financial hit in the process, landlords will be understandably frustrated and left wondering whether the pain was really worth it.\"\n\nShe added: \"We can only hope that the timing of the administration isn't an attempt to avoid paying rent on the 20 units which have been sold.\" Rent owed to a landlord prior to the appointment of administrators is not treated as a cost of the administration. This has in the past led to tenants being put into administration just after quarter day â the last one was on Saturday â so they can use the premises for the remainder of the quarter without having to pay rent, she said.\n\nChristopher Sheldon, who was made redundant in 2009, said: \"Chris Ronnie ruined the reputation of the company in his short tenure of JJB.

No exhaust pipe means no harmful pollutants, right? Well, wrong, of course. It's well known that where the electricity comes from to power the car is a huge factor, and the manufacturing of electric cars is more environmentally taxing than producing conventional cars as well. In fact, a new study from the Norwegian Institute of Science and Technology investigates just this idea, and finds, among other things, that electric vehicle production produces twice as much climate change potential as does the production of conventional cars. As they say:\n\nMuch of the performance of EVs environmentally has to do with how long they're kept on the road. They are efficient, so the longer they stay on the road, the more they can make up for the impacts of their production. And, in places like Europe where electricity is generated from a wide variety of sources, including renewable energy, they do represent a \"10% to 24% decrease in global warming potential (GWP) relative to conventional diesel or gasoline vehicles assuming lifetimes of 150,000 km.\"\n\nIf you live somewhere with oil or coal-fired power plants, then having an electric car is actually far worse for the environment than a comparable gas or diesel car. This includes many areas of the US.\n\nThe electric cars themselves do have significant efficiency and environmental advantages (as well as maintenance) over internal-combustion vehicles, but they're only part of the overall system. Eventually, manfacturing methods will improve, and more and more electricity will be generated from renewable, green sources.\n\nIf you have an electric car, and are genuinely concerned about the environmental impact (which is admirable, of course) then I hope you like your car, because to make it return on its green promises, you need to keep it a good long time. Battery pack replacement is still a bit of an unknown, but, according to one Ford engineer I spoke with, they're holding up much better than previously anticipated.

The electric car might be a trade-in of an old set of pollution problems for a new set. Thanks but no thanks to a misguided cadre selling on the green revolution. Electric cars will eventually be one more pollutant source to campaign over. The study, \"Comparative Environmental Life Cycle Assessment of Conventional and Electric Vehicles,\" appears in the Journal of Industrial Ecology. Researchers from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology declared in the study that \"EVs exhibit the potential for significant increases in human toxicity, freshwater eco-toxicity, freshwater eutrophication, and metal depletion impacts, largely emanating from the vehicle supply chain.\"\n\nThe \"supply chain\" part of the statement is key to the focus of their research. The electric car has been promoted heavily as a car for the future but quick takes on EVs as environmental vehicles of choice should be replaced with longer and careful looks, even oversight, at what occurs during the entire cradle-to-gate life cycle of a car's production, use, and dismantling.\n\nLight-duty vehicles account for approximately 10 percent of global energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and policy makers have braced themselves for what that means in climate change and air quality. In the Norwegian study, the authors looked at conventional and electric vehicles to see how all phases, from production to use to dismantling, affect the environment. They concluded that, \"Although EVs are an important technological breakthrough with substantial potential environmental benefits, these cannot be harnessed everywhere and in every condition. Our results clearly indicate that it is counterproductive to promote EVs in areas where electricity is primarily produced from lignite, coal, or even heavy oil combustion.\"\n\nThe authors warned that the \"elimination of tailpipe emissions at the expense of increased emissions in the vehicle and electricity production chains\" carries risks for policy makers and stakeholders. The authors support serious attention to \"life cycle\" thinking. Their research was partly funded by the Norwegian Research Council under the E-Car Project\n\nEarlier this year, reports of a study of vehicle types in China concluded that electric cars have an overall impact on pollution that could be more harmful to health than conventional vehicles. The researchers in that study examined pollution in 34 Chinese cities and they found that the electricity generated by power stations to drive electric vehicles led to more fine particle emissions than petrol-powered transport. They analyzed five vehicle types—gasoline and diesel cars, diesel buses, e-bikes and e-cars.\n\n\n\nMore information: Comparative Environmental Life Cycle Assessment of Conventional and Electric Vehicles, Troy R.

DOI: 10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00532.x\n\nAbstract \n\nElectric vehicles (EVs) coupled with low-carbon electricity sources offer the potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and exposure to tailpipe emissions from personal transportation. In considering these benefits, it is important to address concerns of problem-shifting. In addition, while many studies have focused on the use phase in comparing transportation options, vehicle production is also significant when comparing conventional and EVs. We develop and provide a transparent life cycle inventory of conventional and electric vehicles and apply our inventory to assess conventional and EVs over a range of impact categories. We find that EVs powered by the present European electricity mix offer a 10% to 24% decrease in global warming potential (GWP) relative to conventional diesel or gasoline vehicles assuming lifetimes of 150,000 km. However, EVs exhibit the potential for significant increases in human toxicity, freshwater eco-toxicity, freshwater eutrophication, and metal depletion impacts, largely emanating from the vehicle supply chain. Results are sensitive to assumptions regarding electricity source, use phase energy consumption, vehicle lifetime, and battery replacement schedules. Because production impacts are more significant for EVs than conventional vehicles, assuming a vehicle lifetime of 200,000 km exaggerates the GWP benefits of EVs to 27% to 29% relative to gasoline vehicles or 17% to 20% relative to diesel. An assumption of 100,000 km decreases the benefit of EVs to 9% to 14% with respect to gasoline vehicles and results in impacts indistinguishable from those of a diesel vehicle. Improving the environmental profile of EVs requires engagement around reducing vehicle production supply chain impacts and promoting clean electricity sources in decision making regarding electricity infrastructure.\n\n", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:26:22.847-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:26:22.847-0400" } } ] },{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "541589722c243f024fc26b95" }, "title" : "Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez re-elected", "articles" : [ { "ext_url" : "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19867445", "title" : "Hugo Chavez celebrates re-election in Venezuela", "text" : "Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has hailed a \"perfect victory\", after defeating Henrique Capriles to secure a fourth term in office.\n\nMr Chavez won 54% of the vote, the electoral council announced, with turnout at about 81%.\n\nBrandishing a replica of the sword of independence hero Simon Bolivar, he pledged Venezuela would continue its \"march towards democratic socialism\".\n\nBut he also vowed to engage opponents and to be a \"better president\".\n\nNoisy celebrations among Chavez supporters erupted across the capital, Caracas, following the announcement of the result.\n\nContinue reading the main story Almost as soon as the election result was announced, the sky above Caracas exploded with fireworks.

Health concerns are also likely to linger.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:26:24.906-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:26:24.906-0400" } } ] },{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "541589822c243f024fc26b96" }, "title" : "USA raises tariffs on inexpensive Chinese solar panels", "articles" : [ { "ext_url" : "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2012/10/10/us-tariffs-chinese-solar-panels/1625679/", "title" : "U.S. tariffs Chinese solar panels", "text" : "The Obama administration called Wednesday for stiff tariffs on solar panels imported from China, setting a tough stance in a year-long trade dispute that has split the U.S. solar industry.\n\nThe Commerce Department issued a final ruling Wednesday that calls for hefty tariffs on most solar panels imported from China, arguing they've been illegally subsidized and dumped on the U.S. market.\n\nIt seeks tariffs of 24% to 36% on solar panels imported from five dozen Chinese manufacturers and up to 250% for other Chinese suppliers. For China's largest manufacturer, Suntech, the rate is nearly 36%, up from 34% proposed earlier this year.\n\nThe ruling's impact is unclear because of a potential loophole. It applies only to solar panels made with Chinese-produced solar cells and thus may allow manufacturers to avoid duties by using cells made elsewhere. It comes amid a presidential election in which both candidates are talking tough on China. Yet the year-long trade dispute has split the U.S. solar industry.\n\nSome manufacturers argue China's subsidies have made it difficult for them to compete, causing about a dozen American bankruptcies, such as Solyndra's, in the last 18 months. Other U.S. solar companies, primarily those that design, market and install solar panels, say tariffs could raise prices, inflame trade tensions and stunt the industry's rapid growth.\n\nThe case began last October when a coalition of manufacturers led by SolarWorld, a German company with factories in the United States, filed a petition with the Commerce Department and International Trade Commission. They alleged Chinese manufacturers were illegally dumping solar cells and panels in the U.S. market and receiving billions in illegal subsidies from their own government.\n\n\"Chinese leaders are well aware that their own companies break trade rules. They admit that fact in private conversations, but they do not do anything about it,\" said Melanie Hart, who analyzes China's energy policies for the Center for American Progress, a Washington-based think tank. \"President Obama's increasingly tough trade stance against China has been a long time coming.\"\n\nSome solar companies worry about the fallout. \"We remain concerned about the growing global trade war, which will only hurt American solar industry jobs, growth and consumers,\" said Jigar Shah, president of the Coalition for Affordable Solar Energy, which opposed the tariffs. Still, he said the tariffs won't stop solar development.\n\nTim Brightbill, a lawyer with the Washington-based Wiley Rein firm who represents the coalition that filed the petition, said the loophole remains a \"serious concern.\" He urged the Commerce Department to drop it from the preliminary ruling, arguing both Chinese solar cells and panels are illegally subsidized, but it did not do so.\n\n\"While today's decision rightly shows that the U.S. will protect its rights in the global trading system, we're also learning that trade litigation alone is not enough to solve the complex challenges that exist between the U.S. and China,\" said Rhone Resch, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group that did not take a formal position on the dispute. \"What is immediately clear is that the future must begin with diplomacy.\"\n\nThe Commerce Department's ruling is final, but the tariffs won't go into effect unless the International Trade Commission determines that the underpriced panels are, indeed, injuring the U.S. solar industry. That decision is not expected until November. In a preliminary ruling, the ITC said such injury had occurred.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:26:42.571-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:26:42.571-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://phys.org/news/2012-10-china-solar-tariffs-protectionism.html", "title" : "China rejects US solar tariffs as protectionism", "text" : "(AP)—China demanded Thursday that Washington repeal steep tariffs on solar panels that Chinese producers fear will shut their equipment out of the American market.\n\nThe tariffs upheld Wednesday by the U.S. Commerce Department add to financial pressure on struggling Chinese solar panel manufacturers that are suffering heavy losses due to weak demand and a price-cutting war.\n\n\"The United States is inciting trade friction in new energy and sending a negative signal to the whole world about protectionism and obstructing the development of new energy development,\" Ministry of Commerce spokesman Shen Danyang said in a statement. It gave no indication whether Beijing might retaliate.\n\n\"We hope the U.S. side will correct its erroneous action with early termination of the trade remedy measures,\" Shen said.\n\nThe Commerce Department upheld charges of 18 percent to nearly 250 percent on Chinese solar panel producers to counter what it said was improper subsidies by Beijing to the industry. For some companies, charges are lower than preliminary tariffs announced in May.\n\nA spokesman for one of China's biggest panel producers, Yingli Green Energy Holding Co., said tariffs of about 30 percent imposed on that company would make sales to the United States unprofitable. He said gross profit margins in the solar industry are about 10 percent.\n\n\"A tax rate of 30 percent is the same as 200 percent. Both of them mean the door is closed for exporting to the United States,\" said the spokesman, Wang Shuai. \"No one does business to lose money.\"\n\nYingli and other leading Chinese manufacturers including Suntech Power Holdings Co. and Trina Solar Ltd. have rejected accusations they were selling goods at improperly low prices.\n\nForeign competitors complain Chinese solar manufacturers get improper government support in the form of low-cost access to land, bank loans and other resources. Beijing acknowledges giving research grants and tax breaks but says those are in line with its free-trade commitments and practices by other governments.\n\nThe dispute highlights tensions over whether China's government-dominated economy should be treated as a free market. Beijing has pressed the United States and Europe to officially grant such status, which would make it harder to bring some dumping and other complaints, but none of its major trading partners has agreed.\n\nTrina Solar said earlier that solar cells or other components affected by the duties could be replaced with components from other countries for shipments to U.S. customers.\n\nIn Yingli's case, though, Wang said all of its manufacturing is in China, which means it cannot immediately replace U.S.-bound solar panels with products made elsewhere.\n\nThe tariffs come at a critical time for Chinese solar panel manufacturers, which have reported hundreds of millions of dollars in losses this year.\n\nThe Chinese solar panel industry grew rapidly over the past decade as Germany, Spain and some other countries promoted renewable energy with subsidies and low-cost loans.\n\nChina's communist leaders declared solar power, along with such fields as biotechnology and aerospace, a \"strategic emerging industry\" targeted for development as part of efforts to transform China from a low-wage country of farmers and factory workers into a creator of technology.\n\nHundreds of Chinese companies began producing solar panels, which flooded the market and drove down prices to unprofitable levels.\n\nIn July, a group of 25 producers of solar gear including companies from Germany, Italy and Spain filed an anti-dumping complaint with the European Union.\n\nThe latest U.S. tariffs were imposed in response to a complaint by a group of companies led by Oregon-based SolarWorld, the largest U.S. maker of silicon solar cells and panels. Some American companies that opposed the probe warned China might retaliate against U.S. suppliers.\n\nChinese solar equipment manufacturers warned earlier that sanctions could result in a loss of American jobs because U.S. companies are both buyers of Chinese products and suppliers of materials. They said Chinese manufacturers spend some $2 billion a year to buy materials such as polysilicon from U.S. suppliers.\n\nBeijing responded to the investigation by launching its own probe last November into whether U.S. government support for producers of wind, solar and other renewable energy technology is an improper trade barrier.\n\nIn August, the Commerce Ministry ruled that U.S. support for six clean energy projects violated free trade rules and called on Washington to stop but made no mention of possible penalties.\n\n", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:26:42.885-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:26:42.885-0400" } } ] },{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "541589b12c243f028874ccd8" }, "title" : "Magnitude 7.6 earthquake strikes Costa Rican coast, tsunami warnings issued", "articles" : [ { "ext_url" : "http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/09/05/160604317/earthquake-triggers-pacific-tsunami-warnings-for-central-south-america", "title" : "UPDATE: Tsunami Warnings Canceled After Quake In Costa Rica : The Two-Way : NPR", "text" : "The Pacific coasts of Costa Rica, Panama and Nicaragua are no longer the focus of tsunami warnings, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center announced just after 1 p.m ET.\n\nAs we've been reporting, there was a strong — 7.6 magnitude — earthquake in Costa Rica this morning.

Por ello, hemos conversado para que la Compañía Essbio entregue agua donde más pueda, y se está haciendo un catastro con los comités de agua potable rural, y hemos solicitado que a la brevedad se de la energía eléctrica a los comités para que puedan tener agua, ya que el agua potable depende de la corriente eléctrica”.Durante el recorrido, el Intendente acordó en conjunto con el General de Carabineros, que se dejaría mayor dotación de Carabineros en el retén de Bucalemu, y que la comunidad se organizaría para ir resolviendo las necesidades básicas que presentan.Sobre Pichilemu, el Intendente se reunió con la Gobernadora Provincial de Cardenal Caro, el alcalde de Pichilemu, y autoridades navales y militares, y representantes de juntas de vecinos, donde se acordó que se dejaría la dotación de Carabineros para mantener la seguridad de la comuna. Asimismo, se vio que no existen olas gigantes, ya que mientras un canal de televisión anunciaba que habían dos olas gigantes, yo estaba ahí confirmando que la tranquilidad está volviendo paulatinamente. Lo que si existen son botes dañados, más que casas y la gente necesita que la luz vuelva a sus hogares pronto. Además, los caminos están transitables, así que no hay problemas para el desplazamiento”.Respecto a los rumores de desborde el Tinguiririca, quiebre del embalse Convento Viejo, o maremotos en Pichilemu y Bucalemu, ratificó que no existe tal caos, “no hay puentes por caerse, ni se desborda el Tinguiririca, el cual casi no tiene agua. No hay problemas en Convento Viejo, está funcionando con total normalidad. Soy enfático en recalcarlo, no creemos falsas alarmas, ni provoquemos más caos con rumores errados. Es cierto que hay miles de casas en el suelo, pero no hay olas gigantes, ni se va a romper el Embalse de Convento Viejo”.Al finalizar el recorrido, el Intendente Núñez se reunió en la noche con el Gabinete Regional y posteriormente con el Comité de Emergencia, donde cada uno de los integrantes dio a conocer la situación de cada una de las 33 comunas de la Región.La máxima autoridad regional destacó que el terremoto ha provocado la lamentable muerte, a nivel regional, de 48 personas, y de 96.772 damnificados.

they have found an effective way to kill the destructive crown-of-thorns starfish, which is devastating coral reefs across the Pacific and Indian oceans.\n\nThe discovery by James Cook University's Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies in Queensland state comes after a study showed the Great Barrier Reef had lost more than half its coral cover in the past 27 years.\n\nOutbreaks of the large, poisonous and spiny starfish, which feast on coral polyps, was linked to 42 percent of the destruction.\n\nResearchers said they have developed a culture that infects the starfish with bacteria and can destroy them in as little as 24 hours.\n\nThe bacteria also spreads to other starfish that come near or into contact with an infected individual.\n\nThe next step will be tests to see if it is safe for other marine life, particularly fish.\n\n\"In developing a biological control you have to be very careful to target only the species you are aiming at, and be certain that it can cause no harm to other species or to the wider environment,\" said Morgan Pratchett, a professor at the centre.\n\n\"This compound looks very promising from that standpoint—though there is a lot of tank testing still to do before we would ever consider trialling it in the sea.\"\n\nOutbreaks around tourist sites in Australia are currently controlled using a poison injection delivered by a diver to each starfish.\n\nIf the new culture is found to be safe, it would only need a single jab into one starfish, enabling a diver to kill as many as 500 of the creatures in a single dive.\n\nAnother scientist from the centre, Jairo Rivera Posada, said that over the past 50 years the starfish had caused more damage to reefs than bleaching.\n\n\"There were massive outbreaks in many countries in the 1960s and 1980s—and a new one is well under way on the Great Barrier Reef,\" he said, highlighting the urgency of tackling the threat.\n\n\"In the current outbreak in the Philippines they removed as many as 87,000 starfish from a single beach,\" he added.\n\n\"This gives you an idea of the numbers we have to deal with.\"\n\nPosada said other fresh crown-of-thorns outbreaks have been reported from Guam, French Polynesia, Papua New Guinea and the central Indian Ocean.\n\nResearch released last week by the Australian Institute of Marine Sciences warned that coral cover on the heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef—the world's largest—could halve again by 2022 if trends continued.\n\nAs well as starfish, intense tropical cyclones and two severe coral bleaching events had been responsible for the damage.\n\nThe study pinpointed improving water quality as key to controlling starfish outbreaks, with increased agricultural run-off such as fertiliser along the reef coast causing algal blooms that starfish larvae feed on.\n\nThe Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies scientists agreed.\n\n\"Any attempts to control these outbreaks will be futile without also addressing the root cause of outbreaks, including loss of starfish predators as well as increased nutrients that provide food for larval starfishes,\" they said.\n\nLast week, the Australian government admitted the Great Barrier Reef had been neglected for decades, but said it had contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to address the issues over the past five years.\n\n", "image" : "", "authors" : [],

In the defining moment of a testy debate, President Barack Obama lashed into Mitt Romney over the Republican's criticism of his handling of a deadly attack on the US diplomatic mission in Libya and sought to cast him as unfit to become commander-in-chief.\n\nMoving to regain lost ground after a weak performance in the first presidential debate, Obama fought back against his rival's accusations that he had played down the 11 September assault by Islamist militants in Benghazi that killed the US ambassador and three other Americans.\n\nRomney, who dominated the candidates' previous encounter, appeared stunned as Obama launched a finger-wagging counterattack over an issue that has become a flashpoint with just three weeks to go in a presidential race considered too close to call.\n\nThe exchange came near the end of a debate dominated mostly by arguments over the economy, jobs and taxes, considered voters' main concerns in the 6 November election.\n\nRomney and his aides have sought to use the Benghazi incident - as well as anti-American unrest in other parts of the Arab world - to dent Obama's national security credentials and accuse him of pursuing a failed Middle East policy.\n\nBut Obama came out swinging in their second debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, accusing Romney of exploiting the Benghazi attack in an effort to score \"offensive\" political points.\n\n\"While we were still dealing with our diplomats being threatened, Governor Romney put out a press release, trying to make political points, and that's not how a commander-in-chief operates\" Obama said, referring to the Republican's initial criticism of the administration's response before the full extent of the bloodshed was known.\n\nMeanwhile, the debate's moderator, Candy Crowley, faced criticism for appearing to side with the president when Mr Romney argued that Mr Obama had not been fast enough to call the Benghazi attack \"terrorism\".\n\n\"He did, in fact, sir,\" moderator Candy Crowley said, siding with Obama. \"He did call it an act of terror.\" A transcript of the Rose Garden appearance that day shows Obama said: \"...no acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation.\"\n\nBut despite that comment, some of Obama's top aides had initially attributed the Benghazi violence to protests over an anti-Islam film and said it was not premeditated, before finally acknowledging much later that it was a terrorist attack.\n\nWas Romney right?

This puts us on a road to Greece.\"\n\nMr Obama said voters had heard no specifics on Mr Romney's \"sketchy\" economic plan apart from eliminating Sesame Street's Big Bird and cutting funding for Planned Parenthood, a family planning organisation Republicans say promotes abortion.\n\nBut Mr Romney insisted his budget would add up, and cited his experience in balancing budgets in business while running the 2002 Olympics and as governor of Massachusetts.\n\nBoth campaigns released videos building on themes from Tuesday's debate.\n\nA video from the Republicans, called Holding President Obama Accountable, weaves together highlights from Mr Romney's comments during the debate.\n\nAn ad from the Obama campaign focuses on Mr Romney's debate remark about \"binders full of women\".\n\nWhile answering a question about equality in the workplace, Mr Romney said that he had sought out female employees as governor of Massachusetts.\n\n\"I went to a number of women's groups and said, 'Can you help us find folks?' and they brought us whole binders full of women,\" Mr Romney said.\n\nThe remark quickly went viral online, prompting a deluge of commentary on Twitter and other social media.\n\nBBC North America editor Mark Mardell says that the body language of the debate was fascinating - a showdown between two highly successful men who are used to winning.\n\nAt one point, they almost squared up to each other, uncomfortably close, invading each other's personal space, hands raised in a gesture that says \"stop - I'm talking\", he says.\n\nThe pair meet for their final debate in Florida on 22 October, with the election following on 6 November.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:29:52.775-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:29:52.775-0400" } } ] },{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "54158a472c243f028874cce0" }, "title" : "Exclusive: 'The Scientology Reformation' author examines Tom Cruise and David Miscavige", "articles" : [ { "ext_url" : "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/scientologys-heretic-how-marty-rathbun-became-the-archenemy-of-l-ron-hubbard-devotees-7618944.html", "title" : "Scientology's 'heretic': How Marty Rathbun became the arch-enemy of L Ron Hubbard devotees", "text" : "There were four of them, and they appeared around lunchtime on 18 April last year. Marty was making a sandwich in the kitchen of his home in Ingleside on the Bay, on the Gulf Coast of Texas. When he heard them knock, he grabbed a video camera kept on his sideboard for such an occasion. Then he turned it on to 'record' and proceeded to the front door.\n\nThere followed a brief altercation which, even by the standards of YouTube, where clips of what occurred were later posted, seems impossibly surreal. \"Come on, Marty!\" bellows the group's middle-aged leader, who wears a camera on his head, \"got anything to say?\" Rathbun asks who he is. \"I'm with Squirrel Buster Productions,\" comes the reply. \"I'm doing an investigation on you, and your squirrel technology.\" Heated discussions ensue. \"We'll be here for weeks and weeks,\" promises one of the men, after Marty orders them off his property. Another adds: \"As long as it takes!\".\n\nThey weren't lying. From that point onwards, men wearing 'squirrel buster' outfits began turning up outside Rathbun's home every few hours. Sometimes, they'd arrive in a car; often, as the long, hot summer wore on, in a golf buggy. Occasionally, they moored boats in the canal outside his home. According to a harassment log local police advised Marty to keep, they'd video him inside and outside the property. From time to time, they'd also pepper his wife, Monique, with hostile questions, often about their sex life.\n\nThe 'squirrel busters' stayed in Ingleside throughout May, June, July, and August 2011. They rented homes nearby, carried placards denouncing Marty, and posted occasional footage of him on the internet. Soon, they became the talk of the village. One day, as news spread, Mark Collette, a reporter from the Corpus Christi Caller, appeared on Marty's doorstep and asked what was going on. The answer left him stunned.\n\nHere, in this seaside hamlet, full of retirees and fishermen, Marty Rathbun was fighting an extraordinary religious war. The 'squirrel busters' were among its (possibly self-appointed) foot soldiers. At stake in the dispute, which has now been running for almost three years, is the future of one of the world's most controversial and headline-prone spiritual institutions: the Church of Scientology.\n\nA few weeks ago, I travelled to Ingleside to meet Marty Rathbun, who is 55 and shares his home with Monique, a lapdog called Chiquita, and several hundred books by L Ron Hubbard, the science-fiction author who founded Scientology in the 1950s. Like many people drawn to the faith, he is an easy conversationalist with a fascinating, if somewhat troubled life story. We started from the top, and ended up talking for a little more than three hours.\n\nMany aspects of Marty's story are disputed by the Church, which calls him a liar, a criminal, and an apostate. But the verifiable facts are as follows: he was a fully-paid-up Scientologist for 27 years, before quitting in 2004. For much of this time, he was a high-ranking executive in the Church, helping steer some of its most sensitive legal campaigns. He was also acquainted with many celebrity members, including Kirstie Alley, John Travolta, and Tom Cruise.\n\nMarty says he left the Church for two reasons. The first is what he calls the increasingly onerous financial demands it places on followers. The second is a series of personal disagreements with its leader David Miscavige, a charismatic former associate of Hubbard who has reigned over Scientology since the mid-1980s. Over the years, Miscavige has built ties to a string of Hollywood personalities. When Cruise married Katie Holmes in 2006, he was best man.\n\nWhen Marty left, eight years ago, he dropped off the radar and attempted to build a completely new life. But in 2009, after renewing contact with a handful of disaffected former colleagues, he changed course. First, he launched a blog, which has become a popular forum for the Church's critics. Then he turned his home into what he calls a \"half-way house\", offering refuge to people attempting to leave Scientology.\n\nSince then, Rathbun has provided a temporary home to 72 defectors. His blog, 'Moving on Up a Little Higher', gets around 10,000 hits a day. It has been visited a total of six million times, is credited with encouraging scores of former Scientologists to quit, and has broken a string of sensational news stories about the Church, including film director Paul Haggis's resignation, in 2010, and January's decision by Debbie Cook, a senior member of Church clergy, to quit in protest at what she called its \"extreme\" fundraising. Almost every former Scientologist I have spoken with checks it daily.\n\nToday, Marty has become one of the Church's most public detractors, and has appeared in that guise on virtually every major US news network. Tony Ortega, the Village Voice editor and one of the most prolific journalists covering Scientology today, wrote recently: \"There may be no greater outside threat to the continued existence of the Church of Scientology than a lone man who lives near Corpus Christi and who operates a blog he updates about once a day\".\n\nI spoke to several ex-Scientologists who have stayed with Rathbun. \"When I left Scientology, I lost every friend I had,\" said Samantha Domingo, who quit in 2009, after 20 years. \"Then I went to see Marty. He gave me certainty, gave me hope, and made me realise I wasn't alone.\" Domingo, the British former daughter-in-law of the opera great Placido, now lives happily in Kent. \"He picked up the broken pieces of my life and put them back together,\" she said.\n\nJohn Brosseau, who quit the Church in April 2010, after 30 years, recalled: \"Leaving felt like jumping out of an aeroplane with no parachute. But after two weeks at Marty's place I got my feet back under me. He put me in touch with a community of former Church members. One even offered me a job. It's been two years since then; I've now got a home, a wife, and a wonderful six-month-old daughter.\"\n\nMarty does not charge house-guests. But he does accept their financial donations. Along with financial pledges to his website, these now represent his entire income. Critics say he is therefore leveraging his former status within the Church for financial gain. In a letter sent in 2009, Tom Cruise's lawyer, Bertram Fields, asked Marty to stop using his blog to mention the fact that he was the actor's former counsellor. \"This is... a serious invasion of Tom's privacy and a violation of the priest-penitent relationship,\" wrote Fields. Rathbun replied, insisting otherwise. Cruise did not pursue the claim.\n\nIn March, I contacted the Church's PR department to inform them that I was writing a profile of Marty, and asking if they would like to respond to criticisms he had made of them. I also sought to check a few points of fact. They asked me to submit questions via e-mail. A few days later, their response arrived. It covered 15 pages. A second letter arrived at The Independent's offices in London the following day, from the Church's British lawyers, Carter-Ruck.\n\nThe Church called Rathbun \"an anti-Scientologist, desperate and delusional\". It said he was \"expelled from the Church for violating Scripture\" and has \"a history of malfeasance\" recently exposed in detail by Freedom, Scientology's in-house magazine, which claims he belongs to a \"posse of lunatics\". It advised me to research Marty via the website whoismartyrathbun.com. Among other things, it dubs him a \"cult militia leader\" and claims, \"Rathbun's eyes glow with a psychotic gleam\".\n\nSince Scientologists \"live in the community\", the Church's letter argued that \"the idea of a half-way house is absurd\". It said Marty had been responsible for \"lies, obstruction of justice, and violent behaviour\" within the Church and had been dismissed from an executive position in the organisation rather than having, as he claims, quit. Because of his work since then, it claimed: \"he is what we call a squirrel (a heretic)\".\n\nAll of which brings us back to the strange campaign that began in Ingleside on the Bay last year. If, in the argot of Scientology, Marty is indeed a \"squirrel\", it follows that the cameramen who turned up at his home were out to \"bust\" him. Regardless of where they came from (and the Church formally denied being behind their activities), Marty came to the view that these strange men, with their golf buggies, weird T-shirts, and highly-visible surveillance equipment, had a plan: they wanted to shut him down.\n\nTo properly comprehend the threat Marty poses to the Church of Scientology, you need to grasp an important point: though no longer a Church member, he has by no means renounced the faith. Instead, he calls himself an \"independent\" Scientologist.\n\nIn practice, this means Marty still subscribes to many key tenets of the religion. He continues to practice \"auditing\", the form of counselling Scientologists use to seek enlightenment, and he continues to revere Hubbard, whose books and lectures he frequently quotes. Like L Ron, he believes firmly in reincarnation. \"The way I see it,\" he told me, \"this faith has a lot in common with Zen Buddhism.\"\n\nMarty insists, however, that the Church, which he calls \"corporate Scientology\", has become estranged from its core values. In recent years, he argues, an organisation created to harness individualism became obsessed with loyalty, discipline and control, with getting members to obey rules, and, above all, with separating them from their money. \"I never doubt the gains that I got from Scientology,\" he says. \"I've never doubted the effectiveness of auditing. But I believe there's a real problem with the Church. The core poison is greed. I look at Scientology, and I think it's being destroyed by this quest for the buck.\"\n\nThe Church, for its part, denies placing unreasonable financial demands on members, claiming that it's perfectly possible to participate in the faith without making financial donations, and pointing out that all religions depend on the financial support of members. In a statement, it added: \"There are no such things as 'independent Scientologists'. Scientologists are members of the Church... Others are squirrels.\"\n\nEither way, critics such as Tony Ortega believe Marty's reformist platform is central to his ability to win over disaffected Scientologists. \"He speaks their language. He's not abandoned Hubbard. He's not given up on the faith. He's just worn down. And the people he's speaking to are also worn down. They are exhausted with requests for donations. Because of that, he reaches deep inside the organisation.\"\n\nIn the eyes of supporters, Marty is not even an enemy of Scientology. Instead, he is leading a sort of Reformation. \"Marty presents himself as a true believer,\" says Janet Reitman, the author of Inside Scientology, perhaps the most complete history of the Church. \"He still believes in the faith, but he's trying to reform it. He sees himself as a Martin Luther figure.\"\n\nMarty argues that \"corporate Scientology\" is dominated by fundamentalists who mandate literalist readings of its theological texts, including a famous piece of literature by Hubbard which argues that mankind's problems are the work of a despotic alien called Xenu who fought an intergalactic war 75 million years ago (see box). Marty would prefer to see that story as allegorical, in the same way many Christians view the Old Testament. The Church counters: \"This shows he is no longer a Scientologist. Scientologists are true to the writings of Mr Hubbard\".\n\nMarty is also sceptical about the Church's rigid system of self-advancement, which requires members who wish to ascend its 'Bridge to Total Freedom' (see box) to take paid study courses. \"There's an old rumour, from the 1970s, that Yvonne Jentzsch, who founded the Church's Celebrity Centre, tried to convert Led Zeppelin,\" he says. \"The band got the sales pitch, and didn't buy, but later wrote \"Stairway to Heaven\" about Scientology. If that's true – and I'm not saying it is – I'd have to agree with Led Zeppelin. Scientology has become a stairway to heaven.\"\n\nMarty's views strike a chord with many Church members who are struggling with their faith. I recently spoke with Luis Garcia, who had been in Scientology for 28 years, ascending to OT8 (the highest level of The Bridge) before stumbling on Marty's blog in 2010. \"Reading it had a therapeutic effect,\" he said. \"It made me realise that I wasn't the only one with doubts. He reflected exactly what I was thinking.\"\n\nI also spoke with Mike Rinder. He was one of the Church's most senior executives, working in its PR department, before leaving in 2007. \"Marty's blog is a forum for information,\" he said. \"That's what makes it such a threat. He's not trying to be a leader of men, or take over the Church, or storm the castle walls. He's just a guy on the outside who wants to speak his mind.\"\n\nTheir experiences illustrate a fundamental truth about the Church's future in the internet era. Unlike during previous decades, when defectors had no means to communicate with each other, today's breed can join forces and make themselves heard. \"There have been exoduses of senior staff in the past, but they haven't websites like Marty's to connect them,\" adds Reitman. \"Now, for the first time, they have been able to build a significant resistance movement, which isn't going away.\"\n\nThe web makes it impossible for anyone to silence critics. Typing 'Scientology' and 'cult' into Google will return more than three million hits. Searches for 'Scientology' on YouTube will turn up a wealth of footage, most of it negative – from tapes of Tom Cruise jumping on sofas, to scatological clips from South Park, to two revelatory documentaries about the Church by the BBC's John Sweeney.\n\nHow deeply this affects recruitment is impossible to say. The Church insists that its membership is \"estimated to be in the millions\" (though academic studies have put it in the tens of thousands). But the sheer volume of critical material that now exists online can hardly attract new members.\n\n\"The internet is a curse for Scientology,\" Sweeney tells me. \"In the old days, people thinking about quitting would have had to go to bookshops to hunt down scepticism. Now, one click takes you to Xenu... When they've picked themselves off the floor and stopped laughing, they may start wondering about the Church that likes to wear dark glasses.\"\n\nMarty's journey in Scientology began on a pavement in Portland, Oregon. It was 1977, and he was walking to a bus stop when a man outside one of the Church's missions thrust a leaflet into his hand. \"Look, man, I got 45 minutes to my bus,\" Marty told him. \"Tell me what it is you're doing here.\" The man said he was seeking recruits for a three-week course that advanced \"a technology for improving communication\".\n\nMarty, who was then aged 20, was a troubled soul. His mother had committed suicide when he was five, and his brother suffered from schizophrenia. He'd been brought up in bohemian Laguna Beach, California, and experimented with drugs as a teenager, before dropping out of college. \"I was having serious problems with communication, so what the guy said intrigued me,\" he recalls. \"The course was 50 bucks. I only had 25, but he said, 'If you pay cash, I can get you in'.\"\n\nThe next three weeks were \"life-changing\". Marty was given intensive auditing, carried out lengthy meditation exercises, and at one point during a \"communication drill\" in which he had to silently stare into a counsellor's eyes for an hour, underwent what he calls an \"out-of-body\" experience. \"I literally exteriorised from my body,\" he says. \"It was incredible. It changed everything.\"\n\nA few weeks later, the Scientology mission in Portland was visited by a man from Los Angeles, wearing a quasi-naval uniform. He was a member of Sea Org, the Church's version of the clergy, seeking new recruits. \"He was dynamic, and he spoke about working to change humanity. I was sold,\" says Marty. He duly joined Sea Org that day. Like every other member, he signed a billion-year contract.\n\nI asked Marty how an outwardly normal 20-year-old could, in the space of a few short weeks, become so committed to a minority religion that he would agree to devote his entire life to it. \"What you don't understand,\" he replied, \"is how much of Scientology really works. The auditing, and the counselling, and the communication drills sorted me out. They completely changed me.\"\n\nMembers of Sea Org are given board, lodging, and a small allowance. They are also offered resources to further study Scientology. In return, they are expected to work for the Church, in whatever capacity they are asked. Marty was sent to Los Angeles, on a stipend of $17 a week. \"It was kind of cool,\" he says. \"I thought it was a great socialist experiment. I mean we all lived communally. We were people who shared the same ideas. I was engaged. You can't help but be engaged. It was a hive of activity.\"\n\nAt first, Marty performed fairly menial tasks. But over the years, his seniority grew. By the late 1980s, he had become a trusted lieutenant of David Miscavige, who had in turn inherited the leadership of the Church following the death of Hubbard in 1986. His remit included contributing to some of the Church's most important legal battles, and attempting to silence its critics.\n\nIn 1993, Scientology won a 30-year campaign to be granted exemption, as a religious institution, from US taxes. It was a huge moment: loss might have bankrupted the Church. In 1995, Rathbun led the Church's response to one of the greatest crises in its history: the death of Lisa McPherson, who had suffered a mental breakdown at Scientology's Flag headquarters in Florida, and died while in its care. The felony charges it faced were eventually dropped.\n\nIn the same era, Marty became adept at battling news organisations seeking to cover Church affairs. In the early 1990s, he helped pursue an epic defamation case over Time magazine's cover story, 'Scientology: the cult of greed'. The Church eventually dropped its claim, but not before Time Warner had endured five years of litigation.\n\nMarty was also a gifted auditor. And by the end of the 1990s, he had worked with a slew of celebrity Scientologists. In 2001, Tom Cruise, who was going through a divorce from Nicole Kidman, asked him to come to Los Angeles for some sessions. \"It was a big deal, because Tom hadn't been on line with the Church for eight years, and that had been a huge loss,\" Marty says. \"So I went to LA and helped him.\"\n\nLater that summer, Cruise asked Marty to help him \"devote serious time\" to Scientology. \"From July to November 2001, between Vanilla Sky and The Last Samurai, he was with me almost every day. He was actually practising for Samurai between sessions. He had swords with him all the time.\"\n\nCruise had recently embarked on a relationship with Penelope Cruz. Marty says he was asked to recruit her to the faith. It didn't work. \"She was doing auditing, and she was doing it with a very open mind, but she never really bought into it,\" he recalls. \"She was a professed Buddhist, and she was continuing to meditate, and that ended up freaking people out.\"\n\nMarty says he also audited Kirstie Alley, helped Lisa Marie Presley during her very public separation from Michael Jackson, and worked with John Travolta (\"a very sweet guy; innocent and sometimes naïve, but sweet\"). He also became close to Greta Van Susteren, the Fox News pundit and longstanding Scientologist, who quietly assisted Church PR campaigns near its Florida headquarters.\n\n\"Greta's very wary of wearing Scientology on her sleeve. But she had this yacht, the Sequoia. She'd bring it to Clearwater harbour when she came down for the holidays. Opinion leaders from the local community would be told, 'You're invited to have dinner with Greta on her yacht'. She'd be very charming, without ever talking about Scientology. Afterwards, guests would be informed: 'She's a leading Scientologist and as you can see, she's also a regular person'. It would really impress them.\"\n\nI asked the Church about Marty's dealings with high-profile members. It responded: \"the Church does not comment on spiritual advancement of any parishioners. This is shameless name-dropping by a defrocked Scientologist\".\n\nMarty's career in the Church came to an abrupt end on 12 December 2004. The reasons for his departure are hotly disputed. He claims to have witnessed troubling abuse at a Scientology compound in Riverside, California. Several other recent defectors who were there at the time have publicly supported that version of events. However, the Church describes their claims as \"blatant fabrications\" which reveal him to be \"an apostate and anti-religious hate-monger\". Either way, he fled on a motorcycle, and has not been back since.\n\nIt's hard not to conclude, taking a long view of Marty's 27 years in Scientology, that his role in the Church made him uniquely suited to his current life outside it. \"Marty was the guy who used to be the Church's enforcer. So when they go after him, he has the full knowledge of what their tricks are,\" Tony Ortega told me. \"I mean, when the squirrel busters came to his home, he just sucked it up. In fact, I got the impression that he was almost enjoying it.\"\n\nThe men in strange outfits stayed in Ingleside for several months last year. Their modus operandi became simple: they'd walk to the edge of Marty's property line, and film there. Any subsequent confrontation would then be captured on tape. \"Their endgame,\" says Marty, \"was to get me prosecuted for assault.\"\n\nWhen newspapers asked the Church what was going on, they denied any affiliation with the squirrel busters. But regardless of who was pulling their strings, they got under Marty's skin. A total of 13 criminal complaints were filed against him, following various scuffles, though none resulted in a prosecution.\n\nAt one point, he came close to leaving town. \"I went to the local council when it started getting pretty heated in May or June, and said, 'Look I'm the guy who dragged these horseflies in here, and I'm sorry and if it doesn't end, we're going to move house',\" he says. But the locals were having none of it. \"They said, 'You're not going anywhere!',\" he recalls. \"The lady who lives next door told us, 'This country was founded on freedom of religion. Who are they to come across the country and tell you how to go about your religious activity? That's not America!'.\"\n\nOn 1 September, Marty recalls asking a squirrel buster called Norman James Moore to stop bothering his wife. When Moore didn't respond, Marty snatched the sunglasses from his head. On 18 September, a police car appeared at Marty's door and told him he that was being arrested. Mr Moore had filed an assault charge, claiming that his forehead had been scratched during the incident.\n\nFour days later, local prosecutors made an announcement: no jury, they said, would possibly convict Rathbun after learning of the circumstances he had endured during the previous five months. All charges were dropped. \"We took a totality of the circumstances,\" said a spokesman. \"We examined the level of provocation and the extent of the injury, which was literally a scratch.\" The decision brought national media attention on Marty. Shortly afterwards, he was invited to discuss the affair on Good Morning America.\n\nSeptember 18th turned out to be the last day the squirrel busters ever appeared on Marty's doorstep. Maybe they had grown bored. Maybe their leaders realised that their presence was becoming counterproductive. They left town on 2 November, no less than 199 days after arriving. Since then, Marty has been blogging daily, running his \"halfway house\" and writing a memoir of his career in Scientology. He hopes to publish it later this year. \"I've seen the Church from inside and out, over such a long period,\" he says. \"It's made me realise that the best thing I can possibly do is to tell my story, warts and everything, and let people make up their own minds.\"\n\nScientology posits that a form of counselling known as 'auditing' can allow human beings to identify pain experienced years ago. The process of confronting that pain will improve their emotional well-being. During sessions, subjects are questioned while attached to an 'e-meter', which measures resistance being exerted on an electrical current being passed through someone's body. Scientologists believe that both conscious and subconscious thoughts affect the e-meter's reading. By locating and dealing with their subject's harmful thoughts, an accomplished auditor aims to help them reach a state of enlightenment known as 'clear', where their negative sentiments have been wiped out.\n\nChurch members follow a study programme called 'The Bridge', or 'The Bridge to Total Freedom', based around texts and lectures created by L Ron Hubbard. It boasts dozens of different levels, which take years to complete.\n\nThe cost of ascending The Bridge is fiercely disputed. To complete each stage, members must pay for lengthy auditing sessions and intensive study courses. David S Touretzky, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University who has researched Scientology, says that, based on price lists he has analysed, the total cost of ascending to the highest level, OT8, runs to $500,000 (£315,000).\n\nHowever the Church calls that figure 'absurd'. A spokesman said that ascending The Bridge involves an 'intensive amount of study, equivalent... to about two years of university study' but costs less than two years of tuition at a typical US university, such as UCLA.\n\nAt a stage called OT3, Scientologists are presented with L Ron Hubbard's creation theory, known as 'The Wall of Fire'. The Church refuses to publicly discuss this aspect of its theology, deeming it potentially harmful in the hands of anyone who has not been properly trained. But details entered the public domain in 1985, in documents released by a court in Los Angeles.\n\nA summary of The Wall of Fire published by the LA Times reads: \"A major cause of mankind's problems began 75 million years ago, when the planet Earth, then called Teegeeach, was part of a confederation of 90 planets under the leadership of a tyrannical ruler named Xenu. Then, as now, the materials state, the chief problem was overpopulation.\n\n\"Xenu decided to take radical measures to overcome the overpopulation problem. Beings were captured on Earth and on other planets and flown to at least 10 volcanoes on Earth.\" After that, \"H-bombs far more powerful than any in existence today were dropped on these volcanoes, destroying the people but freeing their spirits – called thetans – which attached themselves to one another in clusters.\n\n\"After the nuclear explosions, the thetans were trapped in a compound of frozen alcohol and glycol and, during a 36-day period, Xenu 'implanted' in them the seeds of aberrant behaviour for generations to come. When people die, these clusters attach to other humans and keep perpetuating themselves.\"", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:29:54.295-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:29:54.295-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.mysanantonio.com/default/article/Scientologists-behind-harassment-campaign-in-1459662.php", "title" : "Coastal town now is awash in 'Squirrel Busters'", "text" : "A group of men sitting in a golf cart at a convenience store near Ingleside watch as a pickup truck driven by Mark Rathbun passes. The men in the cart refer to themselves \"Squirrel Busters\" and say they're making a documentary film about Rathbun.\n\nCarol Regnier of the Bahia Marina holds a photos of individuals who sau they are making a documentary film about Rathbun. She says the people aren't welcome at her store.\n\nIn these still photos from an Internet video, men with video equipment and \"Squirrel Busters\" shirts confront Mark Rathbun at his home in Ingleside. The shirts feature a picture with Rathbun's head imposed on the body of a squirrel.\n\nThis is the cover page of a pamphlet published by a group of people who claim to be making a documentary film about Mark Rathbun who lives in Ingleside on the Bay.\n\nMonique Rathbun with her husband. The couple married last year, and Monique Rathbun says she has been targeted by people associated with the Church of Scientology.\n\nINGLESIDE ON THE BAY — The first time Charlie Orr saw the group of men outside his home, wearing odd helmets and sky blue shirts with a “Squirrel Busters” insignia on the chest, he assumed a neighbor had a rodent infestation.\n\n“I thought, ‘Well, we had a termite man out here. Maybe we have a squirrel problem I didn't know about,'” he recalled.\n\nBut as Orr, 70, and other residents of this idyllic coastal community of palm trees, elegant white skiffs and pastel-colored homes soon learned — to their continuing regret — the Squirrel Busters had no interest in tree-climbing varmints.\n\nInstead, they were targeting Orr's next-door neighbor, Mark Rathbun, 54, a high-level defector from the Church of Scientology who has become an outspoken critic of the church, denouncing its leadership as despotic and abusive.\n\n“The whole idea is to make my life a living hell. To rattle me. They want to shut me up by any means necessary,” said Rathbun, who left the church in 2004, moved here in 2006, and now counsels other ex-church members.\n\n“They want to make me an enemy of Scientology. I'm the best friend of Scientology. I'm saying these guys have corrupted it,” he said.\n\nFounded six decades ago by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard, the author of “Dianetics,” Scientology's focus is on self-betterment and spiritual advancement. But its history is ridden with conflict and lawsuits, and it wasn't until 1993, after years of bitter litigation, that the IRS recognized it as a church.\n\nScientology began cultivating celebrities decades ago, and among its better-known current adherents are movie stars Tom Cruise and John Travolta.\n\nBut the church is unforgiving of those who leave, and a “squirrel” is someone who also espouses false doctrines. These days, Rathbun is the biggest “squirrel” in the forest.\n\nLong a haven for people who want to fish, boat and gaze at sunsets, Ingleside on the Bay is an unlikely stage for the bizarre and nasty religious drama now playing here.\n\nAs reported in the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, the messy Scientology spat has involved public confrontations and calls to police, and led the city to draft an ordinance to regulate independent filmmakers such as the Squirrel Busters Productions.\n\nWith that item on the City Council agenda Tuesday evening, more than 50 people turned out for the meeting, about five times normal. More than three-dozen signed a petition urging that the Squirrel Busters be denied a permit.\n\nThe matter was tabled after the group withdrew its application, claiming the ordinance was unconstitutional and unenforceable, and could draw the city into “litigation it cannot win.”\n\nIn response, the city has referred the matter to legal counsel.\n\n“It's just an unfortunate situation. It's aggravated somewhat by the videotaping back and forth by both sides that ends up on YouTube,” Mayor Howard Gillespie said. “I'm hoping it will not be as confrontational as it has been. I hope they do their videotaping and leave.”\n\nBesides following Rathbun around, the Squirrel Busters have handed out a lurid pamphlet titled “Neighborhood Alert” that describes him as a mentally imbalanced, violent criminal who was expelled from the church.\n\nTheir literature also accuses him of “spreading sensational lies to the media and starting and promoting his own cult-like hate group.”\n\nAfter several failed attempts to rent a house near Rathbun's, the group now occupies one about a block away with a clear view of his residence. Rathbun said they also have come to his door, followed him around in a golf cart and used a paddle boat to spy on him from a backyard canal.\n\nBart Parr, one of several Californians on Squirrel Busters assignment, insisted the mission is purely journalistic and not harassment.\n\n“We're here to shoot a documentary of Mr. Rathbun and his activities. We don't follow him around, he follows us around,” he said last week. “The Squirrel Busters are trying to show what people like Mr. Rathbun, who are squirrels, are doing.”\n\nParr said he's not a Scientologist, and insisted the church has no connection to the Squirrel Busters activities. Instead, he said, it is privately funded by unnamed Scientologists.\n\n“We're not going to be here indefinitely,” he said. “We'll finish the documentary in the next month and a half.”\n\nAttempts Friday to reach Scientology spokeswoman Linda Wieland in Los Angeles were not successful. Wieland earlier had said the church has no connection to the Squirrel Busters.\n\nRathbun, who joined the Scientologists at age 20, rose to its highest echelons before falling out with church leadership.\n\n“I had the No. 2 position from 1998 until I left. I answered to no one but David Miscavige, who was chairman of the board,” he said. “I was the personal counselor for Tom Cruise, Lisa Marie Presley, John Travolta and Kirstie Alley.”\n\nRathbun, who also was the church's director of external legal affairs, said he left abruptly after witnessing the harsh beating of a colleague.\n\n“I knew it was coming, but that was the snapping point,” he said.\n\nHe came to the Texas Coast, and kept a low profile until about two years ago, when he began giving a series of lengthy interviews to outlets ranging from CNN to the New Yorker to the St. Petersburg Times, in which he describes Scientology as more of a cult than religion.\n\n“I did a lot of soul-searching before going public. I was concerned there might be some type of Waco or Jonestown event,” he said.\n\nRathbun said he also has spoken to the FBI several times about abuses within the church.\n\nHis wife, Monique, whom he married last year, also has been targeted.\n\n“They've gone so far as to try and convince me he's evil and I should get away from him. They've gone to my friends and my ex-husband,” she said. “They've got websites up, saying I'm a man. And they smear me on their little blogs.”\n\nRathbun's website and blog now attract heavy daily traffic, and he has become a de facto leader of Scientology's “independent movement.”\n\nHe said the increasingly aggressive behavior of the Squirrel Busters means church leaders are desperate to shut him up.\n\n“You're seeing stuff playing out here that is unprecedented. That's why I feel the whole thing is melting down,” he said.\n\nAnd as the conflict has worsened and become better known, public opinion on the bay has hardened against the Squirrel Busters. Orr, who describes the Rathbuns as perfect neighbors, got fed up long ago.\n\n“I've told people I'm thinking of forming a group called the ‘Ass Busters,'” he growled. “We'll block the street, capture them and take 'em all about 50 miles out in the gulf and see if they can swim back.”\n\nDown at the Bahia Marina, a sign on the door tells all Squirrel Busters they will be arrested for trespassing if they set foot on the premises. The owner, Carol Regnier, also has ordered several dozen more signs to be sold at cost to residents with similar sentiments.\n\nShe said she first encountered the group with video cameras near the marina entrance.\n\n“They told me they were doing a documentary on one of our neighbors, that he was a very notorious figure. They wouldn't tell me what he had done, but said it was something religious. So, I'm thinking, ‘My God, this guy has molested kids in the church,'” Regnier said.\n\n“Before they left, one of the young men said, ‘We'll have him out of there in less than two months,' so I knew it wasn't a documentary,” she said.\n\nShe said the group members twice tried to rent houses near Rathbun's, but that she turned them down because she felt they were being dishonest about their intentions.\n\n“What's strange to me is them spending all this money on this. How much good works could they do instead? It's supposed to be a church. Why aren't they doing things to help people?” she asked.\n\nOn Wednesday night, yet another encounter between Rathbun and several of the Squirrel Busters at a local business led to an ultimatum.\n\n“Every time those two groups end up at my restaurant, the police come, and it's hard enough running a restaurant in this town,” said Christian Wiseman, owner of Nightlingers, a steakhouse in nearby Ingleside.\n\nWhen Rathbun complained that Ralph Gomez, one of the Squirrel Busters, had approached his group in the restaurant and taken photos or video, Wiseman had had enough.\n\n“I went up to Ralph. I said, ‘Look, dude. I'm only gonna tell you once. Any more shenanigans, and you'll be stuck eating at McDonalds or Sonic. I'm not going to have you harassing my customers,'” he said.\n\nBut the great Scientology spat shows no signs of abating. How it will end is anyone's guess, but few think it will be pretty.\n\n“Both sides are pretty dug in and Mark is not going anywhere. I don't see him running away and they're pretty tenacious. It seems like a standoff,” Wiseman said. “It's completely bizarre. It reminds me of kids playing spy, all the little intrigues, and people following each other around with cameras. It's not what we would consider adult behavior.”", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:29:57.635-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:29:57.635-0400" } } ] },{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "54158a522c243f028874cce1" }, "title" : "Bremer Freimarkt, oldest fair in Germany, reaches its climax", "articles" : [ { "ext_url" : "http://www.kreiszeitung.de/lokales/freimarkt-bremen/freimarkt-aktuell/freimarkt-historie-eroeffnung-2553867.html", "title" : "Freimarkt in Bremen mit historischer Eröffnung am Freitag", "text" : "Bremen - Von Thomas Kuzaj · Um die historische Dimension des Freimarkts vor Augen zur führen, gehört seit ein paar Jahren ein Historienspektakel zum Eröffnungstag. Morgen, Freitag, soll es wieder so sein.\n\nAm Nachmittag legt der Gesandte des Kaisers (in Gestalt des Shakespeare-Company-Schauspielers Erik Roßbander) mit einer Kogge (in Gestalt eines Nachbaus) am Martinianleger an, um den Bremern die Jahrmarktsgerechtigkeit zu überreichen – das Recht, zweimal im Jahr einen Markt abzuhalten. Auf dieses Dokument aus dem Jahr 1035 geht die Freimarktstradition zurück: 977 Jahre Freiheit des Handels. Ein Gedanke, der bei all dem Treiben in Karussells und Zelten ja bisweilen etwas ins Abseits rückt.\n\nGut also, dass es Roßbanders Auftritt gibt. Im besten Sinne Volksschauspieler, genießt er die Rolle, das sprichwörtliche Bad in der Menge. Geplant ist, dass die Kogge um etwa 15 Uhr in „See“ sticht und um 15.30 Uhr den Martinianleger erreicht. Bürgerschaftspräsident Christian Weber (SPD), Bremens protokollarisch ranghöchster Vertreter der Gegenwart, soll den Gesandten der Vergangenheit dort gebührend empfangen und begrüßen.\n\nÜber Schlachte, Erste Schlachtpforte, Bredenstraße und Stintbrücke zieht der kaiserliche Tross samt Parlamentspräsident dann zum Marktplatz. Gaukler gehören dazu – und eine Folklore-Tanzgruppe aus Bremens polnischer Partnerstadt Danzig. Es folgt ein (interner) Empfang im Haus der Bürgerschaft. Um 16 Uhr beginnt ein Programm auf der Bühne am Dom. Der Gesandte wird um 16.30 Uhr auf dieser Bühne erwartet, um den Bremern die Freiheit des Marktes einmal mehr zu vermitteln. Ja, die Freiheit der Märkte! Hier kommt auch Innen- und Freimarktssenator Ulrich Mäurer (SPD) hinzu. Und, der Historie und den Machtverhältnissen von einst folgend, ein Bischof. Die Tanzgruppe tanzt.\n\nDanach wiederum bewegt sich der Tross zum Roland, dem Symbol bremischer Freiheit. Wie in jedem Jahr, so bekommt der Roland auch dieses Mal sein Freimarktsherz umgehängt – von Schornsteinfegern, die diese Aufgabe stets gern übernehmen. Geplanter Zeitpunkt: 17 Uhr.\n\nDie Zeiten können sich natürlich noch ein wenig verändern, so eine Freimarktseröffnung folgt ja schließlich nicht einem total strengen Protokoll. Sondern bisweilen auch der spontanen Eingebung und den Bewegungen des Publikums.\n\nWenn der Roland sein Herz bekommen hat und das auch ausreichend gewürdigt wurde, fahren die Beteiligten mit einer historischen Straßenbahn in Richtung Bürgerweide – obwohl es um 1035 wirklich noch keine Bahnen gab, nicht mal historische.\n\nIm Bayernzelt beginnt um 18 Uhr die offizielle Freimarktseröffnung mit 800 Ehrengästen, so Freimarkts-Urgestein Carl-Hans Röhrßen. Claudia Lange, die insgesamt 17 Jahre Marktmeisterin war, soll hier mit tüchtigem Dank verabschiedet werden (wir berichteten). Senator Mäurer sticht das erste Bierfass an. Die neue „Miss Freimarkt“, von der Jury einstimmig gewählt, wird vorgestellt.\n\nUnd die „Blues Brothers“ sollen für weitere Stimmung sorgen. Röhrßen: „1980 soll‘s da einen Film gegeben haben. Schon damals bin ich nicht mehr ins Kino gegangen. . .“ Aber den Musikern eile ein ausgezeichneter Ruf voraus.\n\nDer Gesandte wird seinem Kaiser davon berichten können.\n\nDer 977. Bremer Freimarkt dauert bis zum 4. November. Er öffnet täglich von 12 bis 23 Uhr; morgen, am ersten Tag, geht es auf der Bürgerweide ab 16 Uhr los.

Instead, they witnessed the latest episode of \"Survivor.\" Matt Kenseth won a wild war of attrition, otherwise known as the Hollywood Casino 400, beating Martin Truex Jr. to the checkered flag by .495 seconds to claim his third victory of the season, his first at Kansas and the 24th of his career. Paul Menard ran third, followed by polesitter Kasey Kahne and Tony Stewart, who rallied from a 33rd-place starting position and a spin on the backstretch during the race. Kenseth won the race despite scraping the wall behind a spinning Aric Almirola after a restart on Lap 173. \"I thought it was over when I got in the fence when Aric wrecked under Mark [Martin],\" Kenseth said. \"I was watching them and trying to make sure I didn't hit them and I flat-sided it pretty bad. It ended up working in our favor. They fixed the body as good as it was when we started, and we had to take less gas in that last pit stop, and the pit crew put me out front. \"I knew I hit it really hard but thought it was centered up in the door real good, and we had a similar thing happen at Homestead last year. As soon as we got the fender back where it was supposed to be, it was fine. I was happy, as hard as I hit it, that my steering wheel was still in the right place.\" Throughout the day, however, other drivers found themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time. The slick, new racing surface at the 1.5-mile speedway produced a track-record 14 cautions for 66 caution laps, and no one was immune from disaster -- not even a five-time champion. Jimmie Johnson's quest for a sixth Cup title appeared to have suffered a severe setback on Lap 135, when the No. 48 Chevrolet spun in heavy traffic and backed into the Turn 4 wall. After leading 44 laps, Johnson had just taken a wave-around for a restart on Lap 128, having been trapped a lap down when Aric Almirola smacked the Turn 2 wall, and the resulting caution interrupted a cycle of green-flag pit stops. Johnson, however, stayed on the lead lap through a succession of pit stops under the yellow, and a liberal application of BearBond kept the No. 48 competitive. Astoundingly, Johnson and his team salvaged a ninth-place finish on a day that could have been much worse and remained seven points behind eighth-place finisher and series leader Brad Keselowski with four races left in the Chase for the Sprint Cup. \n\nThe Chase for the Sprint Cup?

Check out the up-to-date predictions. \"I'm very proud, but also disappointed,\" Johnson said. \"I crashed the car. I spun out trying to get inside the 56 [Truex]. He bobbled a little in front of me, and I thought that was an opportunity to jump in the gas real hard. \"When I did that, my car took off and I couldn't catch it. All-in-all, a good day, but it could have been a lot better. I think we could have been in Victory Lane, and stretched some points on these guys.\" Keselowski, who fought his way forward from the 25th starting position was thankful for a day that ended with his No. 2 Dodge intact. \"I'm ready to go home and have a couple beers,\" Keselowski said after climbing from his car.\"It's just been a long day, Everybody has been asking all season long where the cautions have been. Well, they flew to Kansas and they've been hanging out here, because there was caution after caution, and it seemed like every wreck that happened today happened right in front of me. \"So, I'm glad to have survived the carnage and brought back a decent car in great shape and dodged a bullet of a race. That's the only thing I can use to describe it.\" Despite the conditions, the repaving job, which included a reconfiguration with graduated banking, drew favorable reviews -- not surprisingly -- from drivers who finished near the front of the field. \"I thought the track was great,\" Truex said. \"The outside lane is going to come in really, really good -- probably by next year, I would say. Their winters here are pretty rough, and I expect it will weather the track in really nicely. • Matt Kenseth picked up the 24th victory of his career in his 468th start. • Matt Kenseth last won at Talladega two weeks ago. • This marks the third trip to Victory Lane for Matt Kenseth in 2012 (Daytona in Feb. and Talladega in Oct.). • Matt Kenseth earned his second victory of the 2012 Chase and fourth career Chase win. • Matt Kenseth garnered his first win at Kansas in his 14th start there, his previous best was fourth in each of the last two races. • Matt Kenseth became the 10th different winner at Kansas in 14 races. • Eight of Kenseth's 24 career wins have now come on 1.5 mile tracks. • Matt Kenseth led twice for 78 laps including the final 49. • Roush Fenway Racing won for the 130th time, including its fifth victory in 2012. • Roush Fenway Racing picked up its fourth win at Kansas, tying it with Hendrick Motorsports for the most. • Roush Fenway Racing also garnered its 22nd-career Chase victory in the process. • Ford won for the sixth time in 2012 and the fourth time overall at Kansas. • Martin Truex Jr. (second) earned his second consecutive runner-up finish at Kansas; also posted his 18th top 10 this season, three of which have come in the Chase. • Paul Menard (third) placed in the top five for the first time since his win at Indianapolis last year. • Kasey Kahne (fourth) posted his fourth top 10 of the Chase, he has yet to finish worse than 15th in a Chase race in 2012. • Tony Stewart (fifth) picked up his best finish of the Chase so far; he now has nine top 10 showings in 14 races at Kansas. • Clint Bowyer (sixth) now has top 10s in five of the six Chase races this season. • Regan Smith (seventh) garnered his fourth top-10 finish of 2012 including two of the last three races. • 14 cautions is the most ever at Kansas and the most of the 2012 season to date. \"Once the outside got working, it was actually pretty darn good.

Johnson came back from a wreck that required him to pit at least a half a dozen times for repairs to salvage a ninth. Johnson's rally left him where he started the day, seven points behind points leader Brad Keselowski, who said he \"dodged a bullet\" in finishing eighth.\n\n\"With all we went through to finish and have it be even is pretty rad,\" Johnson said of not losing ground against Keselowski with four races left in NASCAR's title run.\n\nIMAGES OF THE CHASE: Gallery of the six Chase races\n\nMartin Truex Jr. finished second, Paul Menard third, pole-sitter Kasey Kahne was fourth and Tony Stewart fifth.

Crew chief Chad Knaus said the car's \"vital components\" in the back were not damaged, allowing Johnson to score his series-high 22nd top-10 finish.\n\n\"Without my mistake, I think we had a shot to win,\" Johnson said. \"Everything else was good this weekend but one corner.\"\n\nHis crew worked through several stops to get his car repaired from an incident when Johnson's car spun and hit the wall when he tried to make a pass.\n\n\"I'm definitely proud of this team and the fact that we never give up, we continue to fight and we try to get every point that we can,\" Johnson said. \"I'm very proud but also disappointed. I crashed the car. Spun out, trying to get inside the 56. He bobbled a little in front of me, and I thought that was an opportunity to jump on the gas real hard. When I did that, my car took off and I couldn't catch it.\"\n\nMany could have said that with 12 of the Kansas-record 14 cautions for spins and accidents.\n\n\"It was weird all the cautions came back,\" Johnson said. \"We see this type of driving at all the racetacks but we don't get cautions out of it.\"\n\nSunday's season-high in yellow flags flew for even the fastest cars. Aric Almirola (69 laps led), Mark Martin (60) and even Kenseth, who hit the wall, found trouble.\n\n\"I was thinking with about 100 to go, 'Man, this has to be really entertaining for everybody to watch,'\" Kenseth said.\n\nDanica Patrick got into the action, too, but by her own choosing. She tried to retaliate against Landon Cassill but wound up knocking her No. 10 Chevrolet out of the race in 32nd.\n\n\"He got into me on the front straight(away) and said I was just in the way,\" said Patrick, in her first full NASCAR season. \"That's really no good reason to hit me. If it's one time, I can imagine it's frustration, but it's been quite a few times with him. At some point I have to stand up for myself so this doesn't happen with other people.

They may have to pay a fine of up to €10 million ($12.9 million) if the court's ruling is upheld.\n\nUnder the Italian legal system, Berlusconi and his fellow defendants have the right to appeal their sentence twice, in the appeals court and a higher court.\n\nAlso, because the case dates to July 2006, the statute of limitations will expire next year, meaning there is a good chance none of the defendants will serve any prison time.\n\nBerlusconi, 76, resigned as prime minister in November amid his country's debt crisis, bringing to an apparent end an 18-year era in which he dominated Italian politics.\n\nThrough the years, he was accused of embezzlement, fraud and bribery, but he was never convicted until the tax evasion case.\n\nHe also faces trial on charges that he hired an underage prostitute and later tried to pull strings to get her out of jail when she was accused of theft.\n\nThe woman involved in the long-running case is the Moroccan dancer Karima el Mahroug, nicknamed \"Ruby the Heart-stealer.\"\n\nAmerican movie star George Clooney had been expected to appear Friday as a defense witness in that case but did not show up.

In Italy, verdicts can be appealed twice before they become final and no jail time is served until the end of the appeal process.\n\nBut the ruling does mean that Berlusconi has been barred from holding political office for three years. Earlier in the week, he announced he would not run in next year's elections as the leader of his centre-right People of Freedom (PDL) party.\n\nBerlusconi was in court alongside 10 others in relation to a scheme to purchase US film rights through a series of offshore companies.

Property industry sources say the building could fetch as much as £150 million.\n\nThe Met's budget plans were presented today before being considered by the London assembly with police chiefs stressing they for consultation. A final decision is expected next month.\n\nIt is expected that the move will take around two years once approvals are in place.\n\nThe Met is said to have identified a site near Whitehall, which would house between 600 and 800 staff, which is less than at its current site next to St James's Park Underground station.\n\nThe Curtis Green building on the Embankment is the former headquarters of Territorial Policing and was once the site of Canon Row police station.\n\nThe force is attempting to save more than £500 million from its annual budget of £3.6bn by 2015 in the wake of government cuts.\n\nThe five police stations that are to close are South Norwood, Richmond, Highbury Vale, Walthamstow and Willesden Green.\n\nMet bosses are also shutting 61 counter services – some of which only receive a handful of visitors per day.\n\nBoris Johnson, the London's mayor, promised at this years elections to maintain police officer numbers to about 32,000.\n\nMr Mackey added: “We want to have a greater presence in London’s communities and relocate our officers in popular locations.\n\n\"Our objective is to make sure that, that underused front counters are replaced by at least three new front counters if they are closed.\n\n“We want to end up in places that are most accessible to Londoners.\"", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:30:34.058-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:30:34.058-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/oct/30/scotalnd-yard-sell-met-costs", "title" : "New Scotland Yard faces sell-off as Met floats cost-cutting plans", "text" : "The Metropolitan police is considering selling off New Scotland Yard, its central London home famous for its revolving sign, as it battles a cash crisis.\n\nThe tower has been the home of Britain's biggest police force since the 1960s but police chiefs are planning to sell the building and move to a smaller headquarters as they try to save £500m from a £3.6bn annual budget, following government cuts.\n\nThe plan to sell the building in Victoria, central London, is one of a raft of proposals from the capital's force. Others include closing public counters during off-peak hours, reducing the numbers of supervising officers and selling off numerous assets, including other property.\n\nThe force says it will maintain officer numbers at around the 32,000 mark. But its plans so far include no detail about cuts to police staff or to police community support officers who can be made redundant. The deputy commissioner Craig Mackey has overseen the plans.\n\nPart of the logic for moving from Scotland Yard is an estimate that £50m would need to be spent to refurbish the building, which is run down in parts.\n\nThe Met is looking at a move to a nearby site in Cannon Row, which would house about 800 staff, far fewer than the current HQ, which the force moved to in 1967.\n\nThe Met's budget plans will be presented to the mayor's office for police and crime, and ultimately to the London assembly, but police chiefs stress they are for consultation. \"No decisions have been made on any of these proposals,\", Mackey said.\n\nMany front counters in police stations face closure or partial closure. About half attract one visitor an hour, which police chiefs believe ties up too many resources for too little a result. One idea is to share what are called \"public access points\" with local councils, and even move some of these into supermarkets.\n\nBut plans such as permanent closure of some front counters, partial closure of others and cuts in local policing management may face opposition from communities.\n\nThe plans are notable for what is not mentioned. Job cuts are not mentioned, and nor is saving money by outsourcing more services to the private sector, as the government wants police forces to do.\n\nIn July the Met's finances were highlighted as being of particular concern by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. The Met must make its £500m savings by 2015.\n\nMackey said under the proposals the proportion of constables available for the frontline would increase to 25,000 out of the 32,000 total.\n\nThe Met believes it can improve policing while delivering cuts, a challenge as its budget has increased every year since 1999, meaning police chiefs are not used to managing a time of austerity.

Egyptian caretaker of the Coptic Church, interim Pope Bakhomious (R) holds a piece of paper with the name of Bishop Tawadros written on it, after it was picked by Bishoy Gerges in Cairo November 4, 2012. Egypt's Coptic Orthodox church chose a new pope, Bishop Tawadros, in a sumptuous service on Sunday that Christians hope will lead them through an Islamist-dominated landscape and protect what is the Middle East's biggest Christian community.\n\nChristians, who make up about a tenth of Egypt's 83 million population, worry about political gains made by Islamists since Hosni Mubarak was ousted last year. Radical Islamists have been blamed for attacks on churches several times since, but Copts have long complained of discrimination in Muslim-majority Egypt.\n\nIn a ritual steeped in tradition and filled with prayer, chants and incense at Abbasiya cathedral in Cairo, the names of three papal candidates chosen in an earlier vote were placed in a wax-sealed bowl before a blindfolded boy picked out one name.\n\nCopts, who trace their church's origins to before the birth of Islam in the 7th century, believe this long-established selection process ensured worldly influences did not determine the successor to Pope Shenouda III, who led the church for four decades until his death in March at the age of 88.\n\n\"Pope Tawadros II is the 118th (leader of the church), blessed congratulations to you,\" said the interim Pope Bakhomious, who was dressed in gold-embroidered robes.\n\nAs he held the name aloft, the congregation in the packed cathedral applauded. The formal ceremony to install Bishop Tawadros, 60, as pope will take place on November 18, a priest said.\n\nPope Shenouda was criticized by some Christians for being too close to Mubarak. Church analysts say he was partly prompted to take a strong advocacy role in Mubarak's era because many Christians withdrew from public life, complaining of discrimination, leaving the pope their main defender.\n\n\"Pope Tawadros faces different rules of the political game,\" said Youssef Sidhom, editor of the Coptic newspaper Watani. \"Copts are now encouraged, and even encouraged by the church, to get out and participate in the political arena.\"\n\nThe new pope, bishop of a region in the Nile Delta north of Cairo, was shown on television praying at Pope Shenouda's tomb in a desert monastery in Wadi el-Natrun surrounded by priests.\n\nBearded, bespectacled and in black priestly robes, Tawadros thanked God, praised his predecessor and said: \"I carry love to all our brothers in Egypt,\" in comments broadcast on television.\n\nChurch experts said Tawadros, trained as a pharmacist before becoming a priest, had strong communication skills and called for peaceful co-existence in Egyptian society.\n\nCoptic activist Peter el-Naggar welcomed the choice, adding: \"He is not the kind of man who would compromise our rights.\"\n\nMarina Nabil, 20, said amid the applause after the ceremony that lasted several hours: \"I am so happy. I have had dealings with Bishop Tawadros before and he is a very wise and calm man.\"\n\nMuslim leaders and politicians offered congratulations and voiced hopes he would foster greater national unity.\n\nIn a ballot last week the candidates had been whittled down to the three. Voters included leading members of the church, public figures and a handful of representatives of the Ethiopian church, which has historic links to the church in Egypt.\n\nThe other two candidates for the papal post were Bishop Rafael, a 54-year-old who qualified as a doctor before entering the priesthood, and Father Rafael Afamena, a 70-year-old monk who studied law before taking on holy orders.\n\nEchoing worries of many Copts, shopkeeper Michael George said: \"Christians fear the Islamists' rule especially because their presence is encouraging radicals to act freely.\"\n\nSince Mubarak was ousted, Christians have complained of several attacks on churches by radical Islamists, incidents that have sharpened longstanding Christian complaints about being sidelined in the workplace and in law.\n\nAs an example, they point to rules that make it harder to obtain official permission to build a church than a mosque.\n\nSectarian tensions have often flared into violence, particularly in rural areas where rivalries between clans or families sometimes add to friction. Romantic relations between Muslims and Christians are regularly to blame for clashes.\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood, the mainstream Islamist movement from which President Mohamed Mursi emerged to win power via free elections, has sworn to guard the rights of Christians.\n\nMursi congratulated the pope and the head of his Freedom and Justice Party, Saad al-Katatni, said on his Facebook page he was \"optimistic about fruitful cooperation with (the pope) as spiritual leader of Coptic brethren.\"\n\nChristianity spread into Egypt in the early years of the faith, several centuries before Islam emerged from the Arabian Peninsula and then swept across North Africa and beyond.\n\nThe Coptic Orthodox church is the biggest in Egypt, although there is also a much smaller Coptic Catholic church, as well as other small groups affiliated to churches abroad.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:38:38.896-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:38:38.896-0400" } } ] },{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "54158c562c243f028874cce8" }, "title" : "Seventeen soldiers die in Turkey helicopter crash", "articles" : [ { "ext_url" : "http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/11/201211108515163949.html", "title" : "Turkish soldiers killed in helicopter crash", "text" : "Seventeen Turkish soldiers were killed on Saturday when their helicopter crashed in southeastern Turkey due to bad weather conditions, the area's governor has said.\n\nThe Sikorsky helicopter crashed in heavy fog on Herekol mountain, in the Pervari area of Siirt province, according to Governor Ahmed Aydin.\n\nThe victims were members of special police forces.\n\n\"The weather during the transportation was bad.

Users of such browsers were forced to switch to Internet Explorer to trade stocks, to do online banking or shop online.\n\n\"South Korea's unique certificate system, driven by the government, has led to the isolation of South Korea's IT,\" Ahn wrote in his policy pledge book released earlier this week. \"Excessive use of Active X is making web browsing less convenient.\"\n\nAhn, a founder of South Korea's largest anti-virus software company, said his government will not obligate companies to use the established online security system. It will also encourage the development of alternatives to the current system.\n\nCritics say the dominance of Internet Explorer in South Korea is attributable to the government's web policy.\n\nStatCounter says Microsoft's web browser has an 83 percent market share in South Korea as of February, down from 93 percent a year earlier but still far ahead of runner up Google's Chrome browser with 10.3 percent. Internet Explorer's global market share is 36 percent.\n\nWhile South Korea's broadband Internet is cheap, universal and fast, its web browsing environment has been criticized for limiting choices and being incompatible with the rest of the world.\n\nExperts said the excessive use of Active X also made South Korean computer users more vulnerable to malware and viruses as it facilitated downloading and installing programs on the Internet without caution.\n\nThe state-run Korea Internet Security Agency said among 200 major South Korean websites, 74 percent used Active X as of July and its use was especially high among financial companies and online book sellers.\n\nSome voters welcomed Ahn's pledge to end the mandatory, government-designated online certificate system, as many believed it had limited their choice of web browsers and computer operating system, as well as slowing down their computers.\n\n\"I think it is a well-made pledge,\" said Yu Kyu-yeol, a 30-year-old web developer. \"I use Mac computer and every time to make payments online I had to turn on my Windows computer.\"\n\nA former medical doctor and entrepreneur, Ahn is one of the three leading candidates for Dec. 19 presidential election.\n\nYoukyung Lee can be reached via Twitter: www.twitter.com/YKLeeAP\n\n", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:38:55.345-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:38:55.345-0400" } } ] },{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "54158c682c243f028874ccea" }, "title" : "Hamas claims Israeli jet shoot-down; report of Israeli soldiers captured", "articles" : [ { "ext_url" : "http://english.al-akhbar.com/content/two-israeli-prisoners-war-captured", "title" : "Two Israeli prisoners of war captured", "text" : "Israel and the Palestinians have agreed a new 72-hour Gaza ceasefire that would start at 0500 GMT Tuesday, said a senior official in Egypt, which is hosting truce talks. \"Egypt's contacts with...\n\nIsrael has killed nearly 300 children in Gaza: UN At least 296 Palestinian children and adolescents have been killed since Israel launched its terror campaign against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip on July 8, the UN said on Saturday. \"Children make...\n\nSome 500 people on Monday staged a silent protest in Tokyo against the bloodshed in Gaza, the biggest such gathering in the Japanese capital since the violence began early this month, organizers said...\n\nAs Israeli occupation forces pushed into Gaza overnight, intense tank fire shook parts of Khan Younis, sending a flood of patients into the southern city's Nasser hospital.

The attacks left at least eight journalists injured. Twenty-year old cameraman Khader al-Zahhar had his right leg blown off when a rocket shot through the roof. At the time of writing, Israel has killed 72 Palestinians — 26 just today — since Wednesday, 14 November.\n\nAccording to a press release today by the human rights organization Adalah:\n\n“The Israeli army bombed Al-Shoroq Tower (or the “Journalists’ Tower”) in Gaza City. The 15-story building housed both local Arab and international media agencies such as Al Arabiya, Al Quds TV, Sky News, France 24, and Russia TV. Local media sources reported that eight journalists were injured in the initial attack. According to [Palestinian human rights group] Al-Mezan field reports, building occupants later received warnings about the Israeli army’s intent to demolish the entire building, and were told to evacuate.”\n\nBy the Israeli army’s own admission, they knew journalists were in the building at which they fired: “We obviously knew there were journalists in the building, so we did not attack other floors in the building. But my advice to journalists visiting Gaza is to stay away from any Hamas position, site or post for their own safety,” army spokesperson Avital Leibovich told the press today (BBC Middle East Bureau Chief Paul Danahar recorded her admission).\n\nAccording to Protocol 1, Article 79 of the Geneva Convention, it is a war crime to target journalists. Furthermore, to suggest that anyone can “stay away from” anything at all during this relentless assault on tiny, sealed-off Gaza is patently absurd. But to instruct journalists to stay away from the conflict on which it is their job to report points to Israel’s reckless disregard for the public’s right to information and the journalist’s duty to provide it. Israel seems clearly bent on preventing information from getting out of Gaza.\n\nUtilizing the same lie it employed for bombing a UNRWA school, a mosque and a hospital during the “Cast Lead” attack on Gaza in 08-09, the Israeli army has justified this most recent attack on journalists by saying Hamas was using them as “human shields.”\n\n“By placing communication infrastructure on roofs of media buildings, Hamas uses the foreign journalists as human shields,” one army spokesperson said.\n\nThe Israeli army’s tumblr site states: “The IDF surgically targeted Hamas’ operational communications capabilities on the roof of a civilian building in the Gaza Strip. The IDF did not target any other parts of the building.”\n\nReporters without Borders condemned Israel’s attacks today. “Even though the outlets targeted are linked to Hamas, it does not legitimize the attacks,” said secretary-general Christophe Deloire. “Attacks against civilian targets constitute war crimes.”\n\nThe recent attacks are, in fact, a continuation of Israel’s policy to target the media and reporters. In Israel’s 2008-09 assault it refused foreign journalists entry to Gaza. In January 2009, Daniel Seaman, director of the Press Office of the Government of Israel, defended Israel’s refusal to allow journalists into Gaza by saying: “Any journalist who enters Gaza becomes a fig leaf and front for the Hamas terror organization, and I see no reason why we should help that.”\n\nBy this logic, any journalist in Gaza right now is an unacceptable “fig leaf” for Hamas. Therefore Israel’s assault on journalists may be indiscriminate and part of the war against information that Seaman declared in 2009.\n\nIsrael’s line of defense has not been challenged by mainstream media sources such as The New York Times and the Washington Post, even though Israel’s incessantly-repeated and mendacious justification for bombing civilian infrastructure for serving as “human shields” for Hamas operations was not corroborated by the Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict (also known as the Goldstone Report).\n\nInstead, the September 2009 UN report found that it was Israel who used Palestinians as human shields once it began its ground invasion into Gaza – just one of the many violations of international humanitarian law committed by Israel during the massacre that left 1,417 Palestinians dead, 926 of which were civilians and 313 children, according to the Palestinian Center for Human Rights. (For discussion of Israel’s use of human shields see Page 19 of the Goldstone report.)\n\nTargeting media is not a new tactic for Israel, and it is a policy it shares with the United States.

One employee from al Quds TV lost his leg in the early morning strike. \n\nThe attack came on the fifth day of heavy air strikes on the coastal enclave which Israel says are needed to halt repeated militant rocket launches into its territory. \n\nThe Foreign Press Association covering Israel and the Palestinian Territories issued a statement in which it expressed concern over the bombings and quoted a U.N. Security Council resolution that condemned attacks against journalists. \n\nIsraeli military spokeswoman Avital Leibovich denied that journalists were the target of the strike. \n\n\"Hamas took a civilian building and used it for its own needs. So the journalists ... were serving as human shields for Hamas,\" she said. \n\nThe military added that in order to avoid worse casualties, it had refrained from firing at an Hamas operations room which it said was located inside one of the buildings. \n\nAbdel-Ghani Jaber, director of a private Palestinian media production company, said two of his employees were wounded when the blast shattered the windows of his office. \n\n\"I was asleep when it happened ... I jumped from the mattress because it sounded so near,\" Jaber said, \"I wanted to look out the window when someone told me the building was being bombed and I started to run. As I ran a second missile hit just above our floor and damaged a room in my office.\" \n\nIn the West Bank city of Ramallah, journalists held a protest against Sunday's strikes. Palestinian government spokeswoman Nour Odeh said the attacks were \"a clear message against the freedom of journalism and opinions\". \n\nThe Palestinian Centre for Human Rights condemned the raid and said that: \"Israeli forces jammed the broadcasts of a number of local radio stations.\" \n\nAn Israeli military spokesman said the army had cut into a Hamas radio frequency on Sunday and used it to broadcast warnings to residents to get away from Hamas properties and avoid becoming casualties. \n\nIn a 2008-2009 war against Hamas, Israel attacked one of the same buildings that was blasted on Sunday, again accusing Islamist militant of operating out of the tower block.

Some reports suggested up to 17 or 21 people had been injured in the blast.\n\nIsrael has been locked in a deadly week-long confrontation with Palestinian militants in Gaza after an Egypt-brokered truce fell through.\n\nBut an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire, to begin on Wednesday evening, has now been confirmed.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague said the bus explosion was of \"deep concern\".\n\nThe White House also condemned the attack as an \"outrageous\" assault on \"innocent Israeli civilians\".\n\nHamas militants have fired at least four rockets at Tel Aviv in the past week, but none have resulted in direct hits or any casualties.\n\nThe last time the city was hit by a significant bomb blast was in April 2006, when a Palestinian suicide bomber killed 11 people at a sandwich stand near the city's old central bus station.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:43:56.316-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:43:56.316-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=292860", "title" : "Terror attack rocks Dan bus in central Tel Aviv", "text" : "A terrorist attack on a central Tel Aviv bus resulted in 28 people being hospitalized on Wednesday morning in the first such attack in the city since 2006.\n\n\n\nThe bomb exploded on the Dan No. 142 bus line on Shaul Hamelech Street near the Defense Ministry headquarters and around the corner from Ichilov Hospital, blowing out all the windows of the bus and leaving dozens in need of medical assistance.\n\n\n\nThe attack was not a suicide bombing, and police said they are investigating whether the attacker left a bomb on the bus or threw something on and ran. Police did say that one man was seen fleeing the site, but would not confirm reports that a suspect had been arrested.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nDriver Nachum Herzi said the bus was not very full when the explosion happened, and that after the blast, he continued to drive for a few meters until he was able to pull over and help passengers off. Herzi, who was not wounded, said he did not see anyone suspicious board the bus before the explosion, a statement that was heard repeatedly at Ichilov Hospital, which is part of Sourasky Medical Center.\n\n\n\nThe hospital reported on Wednesday night that, of a total 28 patients taken for treatment, five remained in the hospital, one in moderate condition and four with for light injuries. Twelve people of those hospitalized were treated for shock and released, while the rest were lightly or moderately injured.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hospital originally reported that two teenagers were the most seriously wounded, but by 6 p.m. on Wednesday they reported that both had been discharged from the hospital.\n\n\n\nDoctors said that, judging by the small number of severe injuries, the bomb was not as large as those used in previous terrorist attacks in the city.\n\n\n\nA look at the bus on Wednesday confirmed this assertion. Although it was severely damaged, the bus was not a smoldering, charred wreck and the devastation was not the same as Israelis saw in the suicide bombings of the second intifada of 2000 to 2005.\n\n\n\nPublic Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch visited the hospital after the attack and said that the ministry and police, expecting attempts to carry out terrorist attacks on civilians during Operation Pillar of Defense, had deployed police and Border Police forces across the country to deal with the threat.\n\n\n\nHe also said that security forces had suspicions about which terrorist organization was responsible for the attack, but would not elaborate.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday night, police reported that they were still on the hunt for a man seen fleeing the scene, who they believe was involved in the bombing. They added that they have beefed up patrols around the city to find the suspect and prevent further attacks from taking place.\n\n\n\nThere were major traffic jams reported throughout the Dan region, as well as in the Modiâin area as police set up roadblocks.\n\n\n\nFor residents of Tel Aviv, the blast was a bitter reminder of the terrorism of the second intifada, when Tel Aviv and other cities across the country were repeatedly hit by suicide bombings that changed the fabric of Israeli life.\n\n\n\nFor Amira Castro, 56, who was hospitalized with shock after witnessing the bombing, the answer was simple: The IDF must launch a ground operation in the Gaza Strip in order to bring peace and quiet to the home front.\n\n\n\nâI have four sons in combat units, and as much as I worry about them, and I know weâll pay a price in an invasion, we have no security for our citizens and the government must do something to make our suffering stop,â she said.\n\n\n\nCastro added that in the meantime she wonât be riding buses in Tel Aviv.\n\n\n\nAt the scene of the bombing on Wednesday, a young Palestinian couple from Kalkilya walked their daughter away from the bombing, and made their way to the bus station after they had taken her for treatment at Ichilov Hospital around the corner.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAs his daughter cried and he tried to calm her down, Bader Badir voiced a desire for quiet on both sides, and expressed his opposition to violence against civilians, both in Gaza and in Israel.\n\n\n\nParamedic Israel Kornik said at the site of the bombing, âIf this is happening while weâre talking about a cease-fire, why stop [Operation Pillar of Defense]? We canât stop; the IDF must keep working until they finish the job.â\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nHaim Shefer, 62, said he was at his home about 100 meters from the blast but did not think it was a terrorist attack because the blast was small.\n\n\n\nWhen asked if he thinks the era of terrorist attacks could be making a return, he said, âI donât think so. Theyâre trying to get us here to show that if we hit them, theyâll hit us. But they canât win by force and neither can we.\n\n\n\nâIâm against a ground invasion.

Hundreds took to the streets of Gaza City to celebrate the cease-fire, NBC's Ayman Mohyeldin reported. Celebratory gun fire erupted across the city, whose streets gradually filled with crowds waving Palestinian flags. Ululating women leaned out of windows and fireworks lit up the sky.\n\n\"Allahu akbar, (God is greatest), dear people of Gaza you won,\" blared mosque loudspeakers in the enclave as the truce took effect. \"You have broken the arrogance of the Jews.\"\n\nBoth sides fought right up to 9 p.m., when hostilities were due to stop, with several explosions shaking Gaza City and rockets hitting the Israeli city of Beersheba.\n\nIf it holds, the truce will give 1.7 million Gazans respite from days of ferocious air strikes and halt rocket salvoes from militants that unnerved a million people in southern Israel and reached Tel Aviv and Jerusalem for the first time.\n\nDuring the Cairo news conference, Clinton thanked Egypt's Islamist President Mohammed Morsi for his mediation efforts and pledged to work with partners in the region \"to consolidate this progress, improve conditions for the people of Gaza, provide security for the people of Israel.\"\n\nIn Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed the agreement, adding that he had spoken with President Barack Obama and had agreed to fight together against \"weapons of terror.\"\n\n\"Israel cannot sit with its arms folded against its enemies,\" he said in a news conference.\n\nNetanyahu paid tribute to U.S. diplomacy and Morsi's leadership, but also to Israel's resolve and the armed forces.\n\n\"I am proud to be your prime minister,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the cease-fire agreement: Israel will stop attacks on Gaza by land, sea and air and stop incursions and targeted assassinations; Palestinian factions will stop hostilities from the Gaza Strip against Israel; Israel will ease the movement of people and goods at border-crossing areas.\n\nEgypt is the \"sponsor\" of the cease-fire agreement.\n\nIn comments following the cease-fire announcement, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said the army had been effective, achieving maximum destruction to Hamas with minimum loss of civilian life.\n\nBarak added that the Iron Dome defense system was \"an exceptional success,\" knocking down 500 incoming missiles.\n\nThe exiled leader of Hamas said that if Israel complied with the cease-fire, Palestinians would as well but they would respond to any Israeli violation.\n\n\"If Israel complies, we are compliant. If it does not comply, our hands are on the trigger,\" Khaled Meshaal said in Cairo.\n\nMeshaal also thanked Egypt for helping mediate the Gaza ceasefire and praised Iran for providing Gazans with financing and arms.\n\n\"We have come out of this battle with our heads up high,\" he said, adding that Israel had been defeated and failed in its \"adventure.\"\n\n\"It failed, praise be to God,\" Meshaal said of Israel's eight days of attacks on Gaza, which the Jewish state said were meant to stop increasing Palestinian rocket fire from the enclave targeting its cities and towns.\n\nHours before the cease-fire announcement, an explosion on a bus in Tel Aviv injured 19 people, three of them seriously, an official told NBC News.\n\nTel Aviv police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told the U.K.'s Sky News that the bus blast took place in the heart of the city and that the surrounding area had been cordoned off as police searched for suspects.\n\n\"This was a terrorist attack,\" Ofir Gendelman, a spokesman for Netanyahu, told Reuters.\n\nThe White House condemned the attack as \"outrageous.\" In a statement, it reaffirmed the United States' \"unshakable commitment to Israel's security and our deep friendship and solidarity with the Israeli people.\"\n\nHamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri praised the bombing, but stopped short of claiming responsibility.\n\n\"Hamas blesses the attack in Tel Aviv and sees it as a natural response to the Israeli massacres...in Gaza,\" he told Reuters. \"Palestinian factions will resort to all means in order to protect our Palestinian civilians in the absence of a world effort to stop the Israeli aggression.\"\n\nSweet cakes were handed out in celebration of the blast in Gaza's main hospital, which has been inundated with wounded from the round-the-clock Israeli bombing and shelling, Reuters reported. Celebratory gunfire rang out in Gaza City when local radio stations reported the news.\n\nThe last time Israel's commercial capital was hit by a serious bomb blast was in April 2006, when a Palestinian suicide bomber killed 11 people at a sandwich stand near the city's old central bus station.\n\nRelated stories\n\nAnalysis: Why Hezbollah is sitting out the Gaza conflict\n\n'We are very scared': Egyptians fear being mired in Gaza-Israel crisis\n\n'Army must invade': In southern Israel, support grows for action in Gaza\n\nAmericans caught in chaos of Gaza conflict\n\nLike most Western powers, Washington shuns Hamas as an obstacle to peace and has blamed it for the Gaza conflagration.\n\nA U.N. Security Council statement condemning the conflict was blocked on Tuesday by the United States, which complained that it \"failed to address the root cause\" -- the Palestinian rockets.\n\nMeanwhile, the head of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard has disclosed his country has given fighters in Gaza the ability to produce longer-range missiles on their own, without direct shipments. The comments, by Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, quoted by the semi-official ISNA news agency, offer some of the clearest insights on Iran's weapons support for Hamas.\n\nPreviously, Iran denied it directly supplied Hamas with the Fajr-5 rockets being fired at Israel in recent days.\n\nNBC's Lawahez Jabari, Ian Johnston and Andy Eckardt, Reuters and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nFollow World News from NBCNews.com on Twitter and Facebook", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:44:00.708-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:44:00.708-0400" } } ] },{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "54158d972c243f028874ccf2" }, "title" : "'Gangnam Style' becomes most watched YouTube video ever", "articles" : [ { "ext_url" : "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20483087", "title" : "Gangnam Style becomes YouTube's most-viewed video", "text" : "Gangnam Style, the dance track by South Korean pop phenomenon Psy, has become YouTube's most-watched video of all time.\n\nIt has notched up more than 808m views since it was posted in July.\n\nThe video pokes fun at the consumerism of Gangnam, an affluent suburb of the South Korean capital Seoul.\n\nIn it, the portly Psy dances as though he is trotting on a horse, holding the reins and spinning a lasso in a manner that has sparked a global dance craze.\n\nThe video also features the 34-year-old singer reclining on a sun lounger in tight pink shorts, gazing longingly at a girl dancing on an underground train in tight shorts and gesticulating at a woman working out on a beach - in tight shorts.\n\nThe dance has sparked numerous copycat versions, being performed by a diverse fan-base including Filipino prison inmates, prominent Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and a Chinese robot.\n\nPopular parodies include one performed by Eton College schoolboys and another in the Star Trek language Klingon.\n\nGangnam Style, which won best video at this year's MTV Europe Music Awards, has also been number one in 28 countries.\n\nIt holds the Guinness World Record for the most \"liked\" song ever - currently with a little under 5.4m likes on YouTube.\n\nPreviously, Justin Bieber's 2010 teenybopper hit Baby held the record for the most YouTube views.\n\nBieber's manager Scooter Braun was the first person in the US to tweet a link to the Gangnam Style video.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:44:04.884-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:44:04.884-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2238061/Gangnam-Style-overtakes-Justin-Biebers-Baby-watched-YouTube-video-ALL-TIME.html?ito=feeds-newsxml", "title" : "'Gangnam Style' overtakes Justin Bieber's 'Baby' to become most watched YouTube video of ALL TIME", "text" : "The insanely popular song from South Korean recording artist PSY has just become the most watched video on YouTube ever, garnering more than 808 million views on the popular media site.\n\nThe distinction was previously held by another pop heavyweight, Justin Bieber, whose song 'Baby' had a little more than 804 million views at press time. PSY made the announcement on his Twitter page earlier today.\n\nThe YouTube honors are just the latest in a long list that shows just how popular the song has become. Since it was released in July, the song has seen a meteoric rise through the music industry.\n\nIt has found its way to the tops of music charts in more than 30 countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain and Canada, while providing material for thousands of parody videos.\n\nIt became a staple in the 2012 presidential elections with the now famous ‘Mitt Romney Style’ video and was even used by the North Korean government in propaganda films promoting their supreme leader.\n\nMeanwhile, such influential figures as President Obama, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt have all made mention of the hit song.\n\nBut nobody was more surprised by the success of the video than its creator, PSY, a musician with a decade-long career in his homeland who never thought to break overseas.\n\nThe 34-year-old - whose real name is Park Jae-Sang - explained: 'The YouTube video never targeted foreign countries. It was for local fans.\n\n'My goal in this music video was to look uncool until the end. I achieved it.'\n\nBut now it seems PSY has managed to take hold of a huge segment of the international audience. He has made appearances on 'The Today Show,' 'The Ellen Degeneres Show' and even gave a special lecture at the University of Oxford.\n\n\n\nAfter his songs success he also signed a contract with Island Def Jam Recordings, which represents artists like Justin Bieber, Mariah Carey and Jennifer Lopez.\n\nPSY recently unveiled plans for a news song on CNN.

It looks like those less-than-secure passwords posed little defense against the intruders. According to Foriegn Policy, few of the emails contained incriminating info, though the media has latched onto a message sent between two press aides suggesting some advice on manipulating American audiences for the Syrian president's December 7th interview with Barbara Walters on ABC. While we're all used to Anonymous supporting various web causes like The Pirate Bay and Megaupload, recent moves against governments that crackdown on Occupy movements and this week's attack on Syria remind us that the unpredictable group is ready, willing, and able to make itself noticed on internationally relevant issues.\n\nWe are #Anonymous -- We are #AntiSec --We are the 99% -- To the #Syria government, you probably should have expected us. #LulzFin #InfoSec — LulzFinancial™ (@LulzFinancial) February 6, 2012", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:44:33.352-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:44:33.352-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2399959,00.asp", "title" : "Anonymous Hacks Syrian President's Emails", "text" : "Anonymous has had a busy week. The hacker collective reportedly released emails from the office of Syrian President Bashar Assad that focus on preparation for his recent interview with Barbara Walters.\n\nAccording to Israeli newspaper Haaretz, hackers compromised the Syrian Ministry of Presidential Affairs' server on Sunday night, and accessed the inboxes of 78 staffers. It apparently wasn't too difficult; many people used \"12345\" as their password.\n\nAt issue is the ongoing violence in Syria as citizens fight for reform. Recently, a United Nations Security Council resolution called for President Assad to hand over some of his authority to defuse the situation. The U.S. supported the move, but Russia and China vetoed it, further complicating the matter. The New York Times reported today that Russia's foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, visited Syria's top leaders in Damascus on Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. closed its embassy in Syria earlier this week amidst growing violence.\n\nManipulating the American psyche\n\n One leaked document making the rounds is an email from Sheherazad Jaafari, a press attache at the Syrian mission to the United Nations, which discusses talking points on which President Assad should focus during the interview.\n\nShe suggests that the American media has focused too much on civilian deaths, never mentioning that soldiers and security forces are also among the casualties. \"The idea of violence has been one of the major subjects brought up in every article,\" she writes, before urging the president to mention the fact that Syria is beset with \"armed gangs.\"\n\n\"The American audience doesn't really care about reforms,\" she continues. \"They won't understand it and they are not interested to do so,\" so a brief mention of reforms should suffice.\n\nInstead, the president should focus on mistakes made and efforts to change. \"American Psyche can be easily manipulated when they hear that there are 'mistakes' done and now we are 'ﬁxing it,'\" Jaafari writes.\n\nShe then likens the activity in Syria to the Occupy Wall Street movement. \"Its [sic] worth mentioning also what is happening now in Wall Street and the way the demonstrations are been suppressed by police men, police dogs and beatings,\" she writes.\n\nEarlier today, Al Jazeera said Syria was disrupting its TV broadcasts, according to Bloomberg. The email from Jaafari says Syria has cracked down on media coverage in the country after they started to \"make up facts.\"\n\nAnonymous, meanwhile, initially targeted a few Syrian government Web sites with distributed denial of service attacks, but later changed its tune. Crippling the Internet in the region could have adverse effects on those trying to get the word out, Anonymous said.\n\n\"Asking all #Anonymous to refrain from DDoSing Syrian IP's as they have minimal bandwidth thus preventing them from reporting out to us #KTHX,\" the @YourAnonNews feed tweeted. \"We NEED direct action. Call ambassadors and consuls. Protest outside embassies. Make Syria an issue that politicians MUST confront. BE HEARD.\"\n\n\"Taking a site down momentarily in an already oppressive regime = unhelpful,\" Anonymous said.\n\nAnonymous has also been focusing on American efforts. On Friday, Anonymous released emails from the legal team who represented Frank Wuterich, the staff sergeant who led an assault on the Iraqi city of Haditha that left 24 unarmed civilians dead.\n\nToday, meanwhile, Symantec confirmed that its pcAnywhere source code was published to The Pirate Bay and possibly other channels, although it reiterated that recent patches should protect customers. That came after Anonymous revealed that Symantec offered $50,000 to a hacker to prevent publication of the code.\n\nFor more from Chloe, follow her on Twitter @ChloeAlbanesius.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:44:33.814-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:44:33.814-0400" } } ] },{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "54158dc72c243f028874ccf5" }, "title" : "Agencies choose yearlong crew for International Space Station", "articles" : [ { "ext_url" : "http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2012/nov/HQ_12-406_ISS_1-Year_Crew.html", "title" : "NASA, Roscosmos Assign Veteran Crew to Yearlong Space Station Mission", "text" : "WASHINGTON -- NASA, the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos), and their international partners have selected two veteran spacefarers for a one-year mission aboard the International Space Station in 2015. This mission will include collecting scientific data important to future human exploration of our solar system. NASA has selected Scott Kelly and Roscosmos has chosen Mikhail Kornienko.Kelly and Kornienko will launch aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan in spring 2015 and will land in Kazakhstan in spring 2016. Kelly and Kornienko already have a connection; Kelly was a backup crew member for the station's Expedition 23/24 crews, where Kornienko served as a flight engineer.The goal of their yearlong expedition aboard the orbiting laboratory is to understand better how the human body reacts and adapts to the harsh environment of space. Data from the 12-month expedition will help inform current assessments of crew performance and health and will determine better and validate countermeasures to reduce the risks associated with future exploration as NASA plans for missions around the moon, an asteroid and ultimately Mars.\"Congratulations to Scott and Mikhail on their selection for this important mission,\" said William Gerstenmaier, associate administrator for Human Exploration and Operations at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Their skills and previous experience aboard the space station align with the mission's requirements. The one-year increment will expand the bounds of how we live and work in space and will increase our knowledge regarding the effects of microgravity on humans as we prepare for future missions beyond low-Earth orbit.\"\"Selection of the candidate for the one year mission was thorough and difficult due to the number of suitable candidates from the Cosmonaut corps,\" said head of Russian Federal Space Agency, Vladimir Popovkin. \"We have chosen the most responsible, skilled and enthusiastic crew members to expand space exploration, and we have full confidence in them.\"Kelly, a retired captain in the U.S. Navy, is from West Orange, N.J. He has degrees from the State University of New York Maritime College and the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. He served as a pilot on space shuttle mission STS-103 in 1999, commander on STS-118 in 2007, flight engineer on the International Space Station Expedition 25 in 2010 and commander of Expedition 26 in 2011. Kelly has logged more than 180 days in space.Kornienko is from the Syzran, Kuibyshev region of Russia. He is a former paratrooper officer and graduated from the Moscow Aviation Institute as a specialist in airborne systems. He has worked in the space industry since 1986 when he worked at Rocket and Space Corporation-Energia as a spacewalk handbook specialist. He was selected as an Energia test cosmonaut candidate in 1998 and trained as an International Space Station Expedition 8 backup crew member. Kornienko served as a flight engineer on the station's Expedition 23/24 crews in 2010 and has logged more than 176 days in space.During the 12 years of permanent human presence aboard the International Space Station, scientists and researchers have gained valuable, and often surprising, data on the effects of microgravity on bone density, muscle mass, strength, vision and other aspects of human physiology.

They will begin their mission training in early 2013.\n\nThe mission will help NASA understand how the human body adapts to extremely long space missions, such as voyages around the moon, to an asteroid and ultimately to Mars, NASA officials said.\n\n\"Congratulations to Scott and Mikhail on their selection for this important mission,\" William Gerstenmaier, NASA's associate administrator for Human Exploration and Operations in Washington, said in a statement. \"Their skills and previous experience aboard the space station align with the mission's requirements. The one-year increment will expand the bounds of how we live and work in space and will increase our knowledge regarding the effects of microgravity on humans as we prepare for future missions beyond low-Earth orbit.\" [Most Extreme Human Spaceflight Records]\n\nNASA is developing spacecraft and mission plans to send astronauts to visit a near-Earth asteroid by 2025, a goal set by President Barack Obama. The space agency is also reportedly studying potential manned missions back to the moon.\n\nKelly, 48, is a U.S. Navy captain who has flown on two space shuttle missions and one long-duration expedition on the International Space Station. He commanded the space station's Expedition 26 mission in 2010 during his third spaceflight.\n\nKelly hails from West Orange, N.J., and joined NASA's astronaut corps in 1996. His identical twin brother Mark Kelly also served as a Navy captain and NASA astronaut before retiring from the military and spaceflight in 2011.\n\nKornienko, 52, is also a veteran spaceflyer. The native of Syzran in Russia's Kuibyshev region is a former paratrooper officer who joined Russia's cosmonaut corps in 1998. Kornienko spent more than 176 days in space as a flight engineer on the station's Expedition 23 and 24 crews.\n\nNASA and Russia announced plans for the one-year space station voyage earlier this year. Rumors of the flight were circling prior to the announcement, with the Russian news agency Interfax suggesting that veteran NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson —a veteran station commander —as a potential choice for the American crewmember. Whitson stepped down from her position as NASA's Chief Astronaut earlier this year to rejoin the agency's active spaceflying ranks.\n\nToday's announcement, however, puts that theory to rest.\n\n\"Selection of the candidate for the one year mission was thorough and difficult due to the number of suitable candidates from the Cosmonaut corps,\" Vladimir Popovkin, the head of Russian Federal Space Agency, said in a statement. \"We have chosen the most responsible, skilled and enthusiastic crew members to expand space exploration, and we have full confidence in them.\"\n\nThe 2015 space station flight by Kelly and Kornienko will be the longest mission to the International Space Station, but not the longest continuous spaceflight. That record is held by cosmonaut Valery Polyakov, who lived aboard Russia's Mir space station from January 1994 until March 1995, ultimately spending 438 consecutive days in orbit.\n\nThe International Space Station is the product of cooperation by NASA, Russia and the space agencies of Europe, Japan and Canada. Construction of the $100 billion space station began in 1998 with the first crew taking up residence in 2000. Astronauts and cosmonauts have lived on the space station in rotating crews ever since.\n\nYou can follow SPACE.com Managing Editor Tariq Malik on Twitter @tariqjmalik and SPACE.com on Twitter @Spacedotcom.

NASA is evaluating an early mission with the Orion capsule placed at Earth-moon L2. Astronauts parked there could teleoperate robots on the lunar farside. LPI-JSC Center for Lunar Science and Exploration,David A. Kring\n\nSending astronauts to a deep-space outpost beyond the moon's far side could help lay the groundwork for more ambitious manned missions to Mars, some researchers say.\n\nSuch a lunar effort would take humanity farther from Earth than it's ever been before, allowing scientists and engineers to work their way up to even more distant targets such as asteroids and Mars in a stepwise fashion, advocates say.\n\n\"It's a really good way to basically dip your toes in deep space,\" Josh Hopkins, a space exploration architect for Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Denver, said during a Nov. 14 presentation with NASA's Future In-Space Operations working group.\n\nBeyond the lunar far side\n\nNASA is apparently thinking seriously about launching astronauts to Earth-moon L2, a spot in space beyond the moon's far side. EML-2 is a so-called libration point where the gravitational pulls of the moon and Earth roughly balance out, allowing spacecraft to essentially park there. [Visions of Deep-Space Stations (Gallery)]\n\nAstronauts would ride to EML-2 aboard NASA's Orion capsule, which is being built by Lockheed Martin. Orion would get off the ground atop the Space Launch System(SLS), the agency's huge new deep-space rocket.\n\nThe launcher's first unmanned test flight is slated for 2017, and NASA hopes the SLS-Orion combo will begin carrying crews by 2021.\n\nEML-2 is an interesting target in its own right, Hopkins said. From there, astronauts could teleoperate rovers on the far side with relative ease, helping explore a part of the moon that remains little-studied to date.\n\nSuch rovers could gather samples for a possible return to Earth, he said, which could shed light on the moon's mysterious impact history.\n\nThe robots could also deploy huge antennas, helping set up a powerful instrument that would take advantage of the radio \"quiet zone\" found on the lunar far side to investigate some of the universe's deepest mysteries.\n\n\"You can do, particularly, low-frequency radio astronomy from the far side that you can't do from Earth,\" Hopkins said.\n\nBut the main reason to set up a manned outpost at EML-2, Hopkins said, is to lay the foundation for human missions to even more far-flung destinations.\n\nIn 2010, President Barack Obama directed NASA to work toward getting astronauts to a near-Earth asteroid by 2025, then on to the vicinity of Mars by the mid-2030s. EML-2 would be a good stepping stone along the way, Hopkins said.\n\nMissions to EML-2 would teach NASA and its partners how to operate without a resupply safety net, for example, and would help work out any kinks that may exist in the SLS-Orion pair.\n\n\"If things go badly enough, you can always get home pretty quickly,\" Hopkins said. \"That's basically not possible for an asteroid mission, or a Mars mission.\"\n\nA space station at EML-2 would also serve as a teleoperations training ground, he added, paving the way for efforts to drive Mars rovers from one of the Red Planet's two tiny moons, Phobos and Deimos.\n\nWhile the path Hopkins discussed was drawn up by Lockheed Martin, it appears NASA may be thinking along similar lines. Agency officials have said recently that they are indeed planning to send astronauts back to the moon's neighborhood.\n\n\"We just recently delivered a comprehensive report to Congress outlining our destinations which makes clear that SLS will go way beyond low-Earth orbit to explore the expansive space around the Earth-moon system, near-Earth asteroids, the moon, and ultimately, Mars,\" NASA deputy chief Lori Garver said at a conference in September.\n\n\"Let me say that again: We're going back to the moon, attempting a first-ever mission to send humans to an asteroid and actively developing a plan to take Americans to Mars,\" she added.\n\nFollow SPACE.com senior writer Mike Wall on Twitter @michaeldwall or SPACE.com @Spacedotcom.

The cabbage, displeased with the damage the caterpillar is doing to its tissues, is releasing volatile compounds into the air, hoping to attract parasitoid wasps like Cotesia glomerata, which use caterpillars like the one eating through the cabbage’s precious leaves as incubators for their larvae—and succeeds. Drawn by the compounds wafting off of the damage plant, a female wasp arrives and finds the defenseless caterpillar. Using a needle-like appendage, she injects her eggs into the caterpillar’s body, and her larvae hatch and feed on the caterpillar’s internal organs one by one, carefully selecting the least important so that their meal survives as long as possible. Finally, when they are ready to pupate, the wasp larvae tunnel out, and through a chemical trick, convince their half-dead host to spin them a protective web of silk. Success, thinks the plant (if plants could think); its cry for help has stopped another hungry caterpillar in its tracks.\n\nBut, as Dutch scientists have discovered, the story doesn’t end there. What goes around comes around for the C. glomerata, as there are other wasps that use them as hosts, laying eggs in the wasp larvae that grew in the caterpillar, like a parasitic Russian doll. Researchers have discovered that these hyperparasitoids (parasitoids of parasitoids) can smell the call being broadcast by the plant, too.\n\nAfter all, the world is a large place. Parasites that need to find a very specific, small host benefit from having a way of finding what they need without wasting tons of energy searching. So it makes sense that Cotesia glomerata and other parasitoid wasps with caterpillar hosts are drawn to the chemical compounds emitted by damaged plants. If they’re drawn, the wasps that parasitize them should be drawn, too. So the team tested this hypothesis by collecting air from undamaged plants, plants damaged by uninfected caterpillars, and plants damaged by caterpillars already infected with parasitiod wasp larvae, then presented those scents to hyperparasitoid wasps to see if they were attracted to them.\n\nNot only were the wasps attracted to the smell of caterpillar damage in general, “we found that they preferentially detected odours of plants damaged by infected caterpillars,” explained Dr Erik Poelman, lead author of the study published today in PLoS Biology. The wasps were nearly five times more attracted to the damage done by infected caterpillars. “We were excited by these results as they indicate that hyperparasitoids rely on a network of interactions among plant, herbivore and parasitoids to locate their host”.\n\nBut how did the wasps detected whether the caterpillars were infected? Poelman and his team wanted to find out. It’s known that infection can change the saliva contents of caterpillars, so they took the saliva from uninfected and infected caterpillars and presented those scents to the wasps, but the wasps didn’t care. So while the infection is altering the caterpillar’s saliva, the change in attractive chemicals had to be coming from the plant. They then tested the different air collections for volatile compounds, and found the ones damaged by caterpillars infected with Cotesia glomerata were only 40% similar to the ones damaged by uninfected caterpillars. Something about infection changes the saliva in a caterpillar, which in turn affects what volatile compounds a plant emits when it gets damaged by that saliva.\n\nThis complex web of interactions calls in to question the role of the plant compounds in the first place. Though they are often thought of as a ‘cry for help,’ the team noted that this may not be the case at all. “Although plant volatiles may function as a ‘‘cue’’ to parasitoids, they may not be a specific ‘‘signal’’ released by the plant (implying a selective benefit),” write the authors. “It is important to emphasize that volatile cues may provide many community members with information and thereby may not necessarily result in a fitness benefit to plants.”\n\nThese findings also call into question the use of parasitoid wasps as biocontrol for managing pests. Cotesia glomarata has been introduced and intentionally released in a number of agricultural areas to control caterpillars like Pieris rapae. Recently, some have suggested that farmers might be able to spray the volatile compounds emitted by damaged plants to attract more parasitoids, as a way of reducing pest populations without using pesticides. But the authors think that this strategy might not be so clear-cut. “Our results show that hyperparasitoids may parasitize up to 55% of the parasitoid offspring, therefore potentially playing a major role in parasitoid population dynamics,” they caution. “Overexpression of herbivore-induced plant volatiles [HIPVs] in crops or field application of synthetic parasitoid attractants may not benefit pest control in conditions where the responses of hyperparasitoids to HIPVs cause major mortality to parasitoids.”\n\nIn other words, the interactions between species are far more complex than we once thought, and we can’t assume we can predict how our manipulations will affect a community—which is generally the trouble we’ve gotten into when trying to use biocontrol mechanisms. The more we try to tinker with interspecies interactions, the more unintended consequences we seem to have.\n\nResearch: Poelman E., Bruinsma M., Zhu F., Boursault A. & et al (2012).

The volatiles recruit parasitoids that infect, consume and kill the herbivores, to the benefit of the plant. However, such induced plant odours can also be detected by other organisms. A new study published November 27 in the open access journal PLOS Biology shows how secondary parasitoids ('hyperparasitoids') can take advantage of these plant signals to identify parasitoid-infected caterpillars, and duly infect the primary parasitoid, to the detriment of the original plant.\n\nPlant volatiles have long been considered to mediate this mutualistic relationship between plants and herbivores' natural enemies such as parasitoids. When a caterpillar feeds, the parasitoids are able to use the emitted volatiles to locate the otherwise inconspicuous caterpillar, releasing the plant from its attacker. This principle has made its way into sustainable agriculture by using natural enemies such as parasitoids to control herbivorous pests on agricultural crops. However, the largest group of enemies of parasitoids, hyperparasitoids, have so far been left out of studies in this area. This is because very little is known about the cues that hyperparasitoids use to locate their parasitoid hosts.\n\nThe new study, by a team of Dutch researchers led by Erik Poelman, shows that hyperparasitoids exploit the different plant odours that are released when a plant is fed upon by a parasitoid-infected caterpillar.\n\n\"In controlled laboratory assays as well as under field conditions, hyperparasitoids were offered plant odours coming from two types of plant: ones damaged by healthy caterpillars, and ones damaged by parasitoid-infected caterpillars. We found that they preferentially detected odours of plants damaged by infected caterpillars,\" explained Dr Poelman. \"We were excited by these results as they indicate that hyperparasitoids rely on a network of interactions among plant, herbivore and parasitoids to locate their host\".\n\nTo show how this complex network of interactions can reliably provide hyperparasitoids with information on the presence of their parasitoid host, the researchers collected saliva of the caterpillars, as they noticed the colour of saliva in healthy, non-host caterpillars was different to that of caterpillars hosting a parasitoid. Factors in caterpillar saliva play an important role in provoking the release of odours from plants, and a change in saliva composition may then alter the cocktail of odours emitted by the plant.\n\nIndeed, Dr Poelman's team found that plant odours induced by the saliva of parasitized caterpillars was more attractive to hyperparasitoids than plant odours induced by the saliva of healthy caterpillars. Consequently, plant odours may actually reduce the benefit of attracting parasitoids to a plant.\n\n\"Our results demonstrate that the effects of herbivore-induced plant volatiles should be placed in a community-wide perspective that includes species at the fourth trophic level, to improve our understanding of the ecological functions of volatile release by plants,\" said Dr Poelman. In addition to the ecological aspects of their work, the authors also stress that their findings are important for developing Integrated Pest Management strategies, in which crops are manipulated to control insect pests by using parasitoids.\n\nAlthough parasitoids are effective biological control agents, this study suggests that using plant odours to optimize biological control of pests may have side effects that could actually reduce the benefit of pest control, said Dr Poelman.\n\n\n\nMore information: Poelman EH, Bruinsma M, Zhu F, Weldegergis BT, Boursault AE, et al.

These volatiles may attract parasitic wasps (parasitoids) that attack the herbivores. Although in this sense the emission of volatiles has been hypothesized to be beneficial to the plant, it is still debated whether this is also the case under natural conditions because other organisms such as herbivores also respond to the emitted volatiles. One important group of organisms, the enemies of parasitoids, hyperparasitoids, has not been included in this debate because little is known about their foraging behaviour. Here, we address whether hyperparasitoids use herbivore-induced plant volatiles to locate their host. We show that hyperparasitoids find their victims through herbivore-induced plant volatiles emitted in response to attack by caterpillars that in turn had been parasitized by primary parasitoids. Moreover, only one of two species of parasitoids affected herbivore-induced plant volatiles resulting in the attraction of more hyperparasitoids than volatiles from plants damaged by healthy caterpillars. This resulted in higher levels of hyperparasitism of the parasitoid that indirectly gave away its presence through its effect on plant odours induced by its caterpillar host. Here, we provide evidence for a role of compounds in the oral secretion of parasitized caterpillars that induce these changes in plant volatile emission. Our results demonstrate that the effects of herbivore-induced plant volatiles should be placed in a community-wide perspective that includes species in the fourth trophic level to improve our understanding of the ecological functions of volatile release by plants. Furthermore, these findings suggest that the impact of species in the fourth trophic level should also be considered when developing Integrated Pest Management strategies aimed at optimizing the control of insect pests using parasitoids.\n\nIn nature, plants often release volatiles in response to damage by herbivores (e.g., by caterpillars), and these can indirectly help defend the plants. Indeed, it is well documented that volatiles can recruit the natural enemies of herbivores, such as predators and parasitoid wasps, whose offspring feed on and develop within their caterpillar hosts. However, such induced plant odours can also be detected by other organisms. One important group of organisms, hyperparasitoids, the enemies of the parasitoids that indirectly benefit the plants, have not been included in this trophic web because so little is known about their foraging behaviour. Here, using a combination of laboratory and field experiments, we demonstrate that hyperparasitoid wasps also take advantage of the odours that plants produce in response to the feeding by caterpillars. The larvae of parasitic wasps developing inside the caterpillar alter the composition of the oral secretions of their herbivorous host and thereby affect the cocktail of volatiles the plant produces. The hyperparasitoids on the lookout for their parasitoid prey can preferentially detect infected caterpillars, although not all parasitoid wasps gave away their presence through this host–plant interaction. We conclude that herbivore-induced plant volatiles can affect the interaction among parasitoids and their enemies and thereby may reduce the indirect defence accrued for the plant.\n\nCitation: Poelman EH, Bruinsma M, Zhu F, Weldegergis BT, Boursault AE, et al.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\n\nPlant volatiles play a profoundly important role in the structure and function of ecological communities [1]–[6]. Volatiles make a plant and its condition apparent to community members at different trophic levels [6],[7] and may, thereby, mediate interactions between organisms at higher trophic levels [8],[9]. Nowhere has this been better investigated than for interactions between insect herbivores and their natural enemies, such as primary parasitic wasps (or “parasitoids”) at the third trophic level. Many parasitoids have evolved finely tuned responses to volatiles emitted by plants that are attacked by their otherwise inconspicuous herbivorous hosts. By responding to volatiles and parasitizing the herbivores, parasitoids may reduce the amount of herbivory that plants are exposed to [1]–[3] and are, therefore, hypothesized to benefit plant fitness [10]–[12]. However, besides attracting beneficial parasitoids, the volatiles affect interactions between plants and other community members that may affect the fitness benefit of volatile release. Food webs generally include four or more trophic levels [13],[14]. Thus far, little is known about foraging behaviour of the enemies of parasitoids (i.e., hyperparasitoids) that are an important group of fourth-trophic-level organisms, because hyperparasitoids have not been included in the debate on the fitness benefit of volatile release by plants [15]. Hyperparasitoids are parasitic wasps that attack the larvae and pupae of primary parasitoids, and they comprise a major component of the fourth trophic level in insect communities [15]. Thus far, little is known about the cues that hyperparasitoids use to find their primary parasitoid hosts [15],[16]. For secondary hyperparasitoids (i.e., hyperparasitoids that attack the fully cocooned pupae of primary parasitoids), their hosts are likely to be inconspicuous because the pupae do not feed and, therefore, do not indirectly reveal their presence through induced volatiles of the food plant. Furthermore, the time window for successful hyperparasitism of pupae is often narrow and restricted to the first few days after the pupae are formed [17]. However, plants have been shown to respond differently to feeding damage inflicted by parasitized or unparasitized herbivores [18]–[20]. As a result, plant-derived volatile cues may provide hyperparasitoids with reliable information on the presence of their host [15]. Many hyperparasitoid species parasitize the pupae of a range of primary parasitoid species, including both solitary species, which lay a single egg within an herbivore, and gregarious species, which lay multiple eggs within a single herbivore [21]. Single or multiple parasitoid larvae developing in a caterpillar differentially affect the physiology and feeding behaviour of the herbivore, thereby inducing different plant volatile blends [19],[20]. Consequently, hyperparasitoids may be better able to locate one parasitoid host than the other, and thus variation in plant volatiles induced by parasitized herbivores may cause variation in the level of hyperparasitoid attack on different species of primary parasitoids. Here, we test whether plants can mediate interactions between third- and fourth-trophic-level organisms by providing cues on the presence of hosts for hyperparasitoids and whether hyperparasitoids respond similarly to herbivores that contain different parasitoids. To study these questions we used the hyperparasitoid Lysibia nana (Ichneumonidae) that attacks pupae of primary parasitoids in the genus Cotesia (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). The solitary parasitoid C. rubecula (CR) and the gregarious C. glomerata (CG) are primary parasitoids that both attack caterpillars of the Small Cabbage White butterfly, Pieris rapae (PR), that feed on brassicaceous plants (Figure 1) [22]. When fully developed, the parasitoid larvae leave their host to spin a silk cocoon in which they pupate. Individual C. glomerata cocoons are approximately 40% smaller (in terms of mass) than individual C. rubecula cocoons. In terms of the per capita fitness potential of hyperparasitoid offspring, L. nana may benefit when developing in pupae of the larger C. rubecula [23]. However, in terms of cumulative maternal fitness, L. nana hyperparasitoids benefit more when finding a caterpillar parasitized by the gregarious C. glomerata. In the field, caterpillars parasitized by C. glomerata produced an average of 39 C. glomerata cocoons. Upon finding clusters of their primary parasitoid host, hyperparasitoids generally parasitize most or even all pupae in the brood, whereas in the case of finding a solitary primary parasitoid they have to disperse after each parasitization. The egg load of L. nana females closely approximates the average brood size (e.g., 20–40) of C. glomerata [17], suggesting that it co-evolved with gregarious host species such as C. glomerata. We hypothesized that L. nana uses volatile plant cues induced by C. glomerata–parasitized caterpillars to locate aggregated pupae and that they prefer those volatiles over volatile plant cues induced by the feeding of solitarily parasitized caterpillars. Figure 1. Experimental study system of the four-trophic-level community on Brassica oleracea plants. The gregarious primary parasitoid Cotesia glomerata (CG) and the solitary C. rubecula (CR) attack caterpillars of Pieris (PR) butterflies, which are in turn attacked by several hyperparasitoids: Acrolyta nens (1), Lysibia nana (2), Pteromalus semotus (3), Mesochorus gemellus (4), and Baryscapus galactopus (5). Hyperparasitoids at the fourth trophic level find their primary parasitoid host at the third trophic level via information derived from the plant at the first trophic level. Larvae of primary parasitoids that develop in their herbivorous host at the second trophic level inflict changes in their herbivore host, and the combination of herbivore and parasitoid (parasitized herbivores) inflict changes in plant volatile emission (I). These changes in plant volatile emission are used by hyperparasitoids as a cue of host presence (II).

Interestingly, only one of the two parasitoids studied here altered the response of its herbivorous host with the food plant and thereby gave away its presence to hyperparasitoids. This gregarious parasitoid species, C. glomerata, was most frequently attacked by hyperparasitoids in the field, indicating that plant volatiles differentially expose parasitoid species to their enemies. The two primary parasitoids that are suitable hosts for the hyperparasitoid L. nana largely differ in how they interact with their herbivorous host. C. glomerata larvae dynamically regulate the growth of their host in accordance with brood size and the concomitant amount of resources necessary to maximize adult parasitoid body size [26]–[28]. In contrast, C. rubecula–parasitized caterpillars are developmentally arrested in the third or fourth instar, depending on instar parasitized, and consume much less plant tissue than healthy caterpillars [19],[29]. However, the amount of feeding damage per se did not explain that L. nana discriminated C. glomerata–parasitized from unparasitized caterpillar-damaged plants. Controlling for the amount of damage and application of oral secretions of caterpillars revealed that changes in the oral secretions underlie the effect on differential plant responses to parasitized and healthy caterpillars. The oral secretions of parasitized caterpillars can be visually distinguished in terms of colour from oral secretions of healthy caterpillars, and several parasitoid species have different effects on the colour of oral secretions [20]. Clearly, the oral secretions differ in composition among caterpillars parasitized by different parasitoids, and the nature of those changes merits further investigation. Nevertheless, application of oral secretions of unparasitized or parasitized caterpillars to plant wounds has been found to result in differential expression of genes underlying the herbivore-induced plant volatile emission [20]. Here, we show that differences in induced responses of plants to caterpillars in which different parasitoids develop results in different blends of volatiles produced by the plant. However, these induced changes in volatiles were only present when C. glomerata had parasitized the herbivore and not when C. rubecula parasitized the same herbivore species. This may be caused or confounded by the lower amount of damage that C. rubecula–parasitized caterpillars make when compared to C. glomerata–parasitized caterpillars. Alternatively, it may suggest that C. rubecula has evolved to reduce its conspicuousness by not affecting the elicitors in oral secretions of its host that may reveal its presence to its hyperparasitoid enemies, whereas C. glomerata does reveal itself through such changes. In its introduced range in the United States, C. rubecula is frequently hyperparasitized [21]. This may suggest that in its invasive range C. rubecula has not (yet) adapted to be inconspicuous when developing in P. rapae, because of the shorter co-evolutionary relationship between P. rapae and C. rubecula in the invasive range. Because of the differences in attraction of hyperparasitoids to volatiles emitted by plants induced with caterpillars parasitized by different parasitoid species, we hypothesize that plant responses to herbivory result in differential selection pressure of hyperparasitoids on primary parasitoids. The observation of variation in the attraction of hyperparasitoids to caterpillars parasitized by different parasitoids that are suitable hosts to the hyperparasitoid also raises the question of whether hyperparasitoids may be able to use plant odours to assess whether a herbivore is parasitized by a nonsuitable parasitoid host. This area certainly merits further investigation. Secondary hyperparasitoids that are attracted to volatiles emitted by plants that are damaged by parasitized caterpillars containing fully grown parasitoid larvae may suffer fitness costs by arriving too early on a plant (i.e., before the larvae of the their primary parasitoid hosts have emerged and constructed cocoons). However, pupae themselves do not interact with plants, and plants on which no active feeding takes place are likely to have reduced volatile emission and are, therefore, more difficult to detect [1]. In addition, hyperparasitoids are even further constrained in host searching as they can only successfully parasitize young pupae of primary parasitoids (i.e., within several days after they are formed) [30]. Therefore, hyperparasitoids are likely to have evolved to respond to highly detectable and reliable cues that predict the presence of available pupae in the near future and require hyperparasitoids to wait, rather than responding to cues that may result in arriving too late. Similar waiting strategies have been observed for pupal parasitoids that are similarly constrained in terms of host suitability (i.e., they can only parasitize the pupae of herbivores shortly after these are formed). We have observed on numerous occasions that the pupal parasitoid Pteromalus puparum sits on or next to final instar Pieris caterpillars awaiting their pupation (E.H. Poelman and J.A. Harvey, unpublished observations). For both hyperparasitoids and pupal parasitoids, natural selection may favour such a waiting strategy even further, because healthy and parasitized caterpillars are well known to leave the host plant during the wandering phase and to climb onto a neighbouring plant and are thus not detectable through volatiles emitted by the plant on which they were previously feeding. The strategy of herbivores or parasitized herbivores to wander off the plant on which they have been feeding suggests that selection is being imposed on such behaviour, which is likely to be mediated by responses of their own natural enemies such as hyperparasitoids. Despite the potential delay of arriving too early and having to wait on the plant to be able to parasitize the primary parasitoid pupae, the plant volatile cues derived from feeding by parasitized herbivores are the most detectable cues predicting host presence. L. nana females generally carry up to 40 mature eggs after several days that are ready for oviposition and thus can exploit an entire brood of C. glomerata within several hours [30]. Moreover, a female can mature an additional 20–30 eggs over the course of 24 h [30]. This suggests that L. nana has probably co-evolved with host species such as C. glomerata because of the strong synchrony between egg load dynamics in the hyperparasitoid and average cocoon cluster size in C. glomerata [31]. Foraging decisions of the hyperparasitoids on the food plant clearly underlie the contrast between C. glomerata and C. rubecula hyperparasitism levels when cocoons of C. glomerata and C. rubecula were exposed to the natural hyperparasitoid community on plants damaged by parasitized or healthy caterpillars. The field study in 2011 showed a preference of hyperparasitoids for plants damaged by gregariously parasitized caterpillars, and this was reflected in hyperparasitism rates on gregarious C. glomerata pupae (Figure 6), supporting our findings in the laboratory choice assays. However, the effects of the herbivory treatments in the field assay did not prevail on solitary pupae of C. rubecula. Moreover, we also found a higher hyperparasitism rate of L. nana in the solitary pupae in the field season of 2011 compared to the field seasons of 2005 to 2007. Several factors, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive, may account for this: first, our method of offering pupae on paper may expose solitary cocoons more to hyperparasitoids than occurs in nature. Second, when considering the total number of pupae in a brood, we offered more C. glomerata than C. rubecula pupae. Although more hyperparasitoids were recovered from gregarious pupae, the rates of individual clutches of C. glomerata that contained any hyperparasitoid and solitary pupae of C. rubecula that were hyperparasitized were similar. The hyperparasitism rates on C. glomerata underestimate the actual rates at which clutches were found by more than one hyperparasitoid. Third, due to the setup of this field study, we excluded hyperparasitism by primary hyperparasitoids (that oviposit in the parasitoid larvae when these develop within the caterpillars). Therefore, L. nana might encounter less competition from primary hyperparasitoids and may therefore alter its oviposition strategies. Fourth, as described above, female hyperparasitoids, such as L. nana, may exploit a large proportion of their host pupae once they locate a host clutch [31]. The hyperparasitoids locating a gregarious brood spend more time on the brood and are egg limited when exploiting the whole brood, whereas they are time limited when exploiting solitary pupae. Therefore, hyperparasitism rates may have been elevated on solitary C. rubecula pupae despite the larger number of eggs laid in gregarious broods. Our study shows that enemies of those natural enemies that benefit plant fitness may also use plant-produced odours to find their hosts or prey. In this way, the plant may be caught between a “rock and a hard place,” in that two out of three trophic levels of consumers that are detrimental to the plant (either directly, through herbivory, or indirectly, through a reduction in the abundance of beneficial carnivores at the third trophic level, caused by organisms at the fourth trophic level) benefit from using herbivore-induced plant volatiles. The beneficial effect on plant fitness of attracting parasitic wasps, to indirectly defend itself against their herbivore attackers, has been intensively discussed [2],[3],[6]. Although it has been recognized that volatiles released by plants that are under attack by herbivores provide parasitoids and predators with a cue that can be used in host location, the presence of active “signalling” and associated selection on plants that are stronger signallers has thus far received less attention. Although some studies have reported a fitness benefit of plants on which herbivores were attacked by parasitoids [10]–[12], other studies have reported negative fitness consequences of plants emitting volatiles by becoming more apparent to herbivores [8]. It is important to emphasize that volatile cues may provide many community members with information and thereby may not necessarily result in a fitness benefit to plants [6]: although plant volatiles may function as a “cue” to parasitoids, they may not be a specific “signal” released by the plant (implying a selective benefit). Although short-term negative consequences of attracting hyperparasitoids for plants may be absent, as the hyperparasitoid is not affecting the direct benefit of reduced herbivory by parasitized caterpillars, the plant may be presented with a cost of reduced population size of its beneficial natural enemies when a next generation of herbivores arrives. Our results show that hyperparasitoids may parasitize up to 55% of the parasitoid offspring, therefore potentially playing a major role in parasitoid population dynamics. Furthermore, the parasitoid species studied here have been found to parasitize over 90% of the herbivores when parasitoids are at their peak abundance during the season [32]. The effect of parasitoid–hyperparasitoid interactions therefore may have significant consequences for herbivore populations, and thereby indirectly hyperparasitoids may significantly contribute to selection on plant traits such as volatile release. The fitness consequences of the emission of herbivore-induced plant volatiles are dependent on the quantitative composition of the plant-associated community at several trophic levels. The fitness benefit of volatile release should, therefore, be evaluated in the natural context of the plant-associated insect community including fourth-trophic-level organisms [6]. This will help to improve our understanding of the function of herbivore-induced volatiles in plants and of how the ecological effects of volatiles can shape the life histories of species interacting in insect communities associated with these plants [33],[34]. Furthermore, these findings are important in the context of developing Integrated Pest Management strategies in which herbivore-induced volatiles of crops are manipulated to optimize the control of insect pests by using parasitoids. Overexpression of herbivore-induced plant volatiles in crops or field application of synthetic parasitoid attractants may not benefit pest control in conditions where the responses of hyperparasitoids to HIPVs cause major mortality to parasitoids [35].\n\nBrassica oleracea var gemmifera cv. Cyrus plants used for olfactometer experiments were grown in 1.45-l pots containing peat soil (Lentse potgrond, no. 4, Lent, the Netherlands) and provided with SON-T light (500 µmol/m2/s; L16:D8) in addition to natural daylight in a glasshouse compartment (18–26°C, 50%–70% r.h.). When plants were 4 wk old, they were fertilized weekly by applying 100 ml nutrient solution of 2.5 mg/l Kristalon Blauw (Hydro Agri Rotterdam, the Netherlands (N-P-K-Mg) 19-6-20-3) to the soil and used in experiments when they were 7 wk old. To prepare parasitized caterpillars for the induction treatments, individual first instar P. rapae larvae were exposed to a single female C. glomerata or C. rubecula, which were allowed to parasitize the caterpillar in a glass vial. For C. glomerata, caterpillars were considered to be parasitized when the wasp had inserted her ovipositor in the caterpillar for at least 5 s. For C. rubecula, because of herbivore immune responses to parasitoid eggs [34], the wasp was allowed to oviposit 3 times in the same caterpillar, to increase the success rate of parasitism. Due to larval cannibalism among the parasitoids, only a single C. rubecula larva would develop eventually [36]. The hyperparasitoid L. nana was reared on C. glomerata cocoons in the absence of plant and herbivore-derived cues. All Brassica oleracea var gemmifera cv. Cyrus plants for the olfactometer assays were treated 24 h before the tests. First, plants were infested with either two unparasitized fourth instar Pieris rapae caterpillars or two fourth instar caterpillars that contained fully grown parasitoid larvae of either C. glomerata or C. rubecula as a result of parasitization of the caterpillar in their first instar. In a second experiment with oral secretions of caterpillars, plants were artificially damaged with a pattern wheel by drawing three lines of 3 cm long on each of the four youngest fully expanded leaves and treated with 25 µl of caterpillar oral secretions onto the damaged sites. Oral secretions were collected from healthy and C. glomerata–parasitized fourth instar P. rapae caterpillars, using 5 µl capillaries. Single caterpillars regurgitated 2–8 µl that we pooled to be used in the induction treatments. We decided not to test the relative attractiveness of plants induced with oral secretions of C. rubecula–parasitized caterpillars, because it would lack biological relevance as the data from our choice assays with actual feeding damage indicate that the quantity of damage by gregariously parasitized caterpillars is likely to explain the preference of hyperparasitoids for treatments with higher amounts of leaf damage (Figure 4). We have restricted to testing the effect of qualitative differences in the oral secretion of parasitized and unparasitized caterpillars only to treatment combinations where we did not identify a statistical difference in the amount of damage between the treatments. To test whether volatiles derived from oral secretion itself may be attractive to hyperparasitoids, we applied 25 µl oral secretion of C. glomerata–parasitized P. rapae caterpillars onto undamaged plants with a fine brush. We tested the relative attractiveness of the oral-secretion-treated plants to undamaged plants treated with 25 µl of water. Shortly before L. nana females were tested for their behavioural response to plant volatiles in Y-tube olfactometer bio-assays, we removed caterpillars and their feces from the plants and placed the plants in one of two glass jars (30 l each) that were connected to the two olfactometer arms. A charcoal-filtered airflow (4 l/min) was led through each arm of the Y-tube olfactometer system, and a single wasp was released at the base of the stem section (3.5 cm diameter, 22 cm length) in each test [37]. Wasps that passed a set line at the end of one of the olfactometer arms within 10 min and stayed there for at least 15 s were considered to have chosen for the odour source connected to that olfactometer arm. To compensate for unforeseen asymmetry in the setup, we swapped the jars containing the plants after testing five wasps and replaced the set of plants by a new set of plants after testing 10 wasps. The Y-tube olfactometer setup was placed in a climatized room, and in addition to daylight it was illuminated with four fluorescent tube lights (FTD 32 W/84 HF, Pope, the Netherlands). Eighty-four-week-old plants were transplanted into the field with 1×1 m spacing between plants and allowed to adjust to field conditions for 1 wk. Thereafter, the plants were subjected to one of four induction treatments: (1) not treated with herbivory (i.e., undamaged controls, UD), (2) infested individually with either two unparasitized first instar P. rapae caterpillars (PR), (3) two C. glomerata–parasitized P. rapae caterpillars (PR-CG), or (4) two C. rubecula–parasitized P. rapae caterpillars (PR-CR). Unparasitized and parasitized caterpillars were allowed to feed on plants for 10 d, which was approximately the whole development period of the Cotesia larvae. Each plant was covered with a fine-mesh net when planted to avoid other herbivore infestations on the foliage and to prevent the herbivores used for induction to wander off the plant. To test the effects of plant induction with different types of herbivory on hyperparasitism, we attached parasitoid pupae onto the plants in the field. Individual pupae of C. rubecula, or clutches of C. glomerata, were first attached to a paper disc (3×3 cm) with a small droplet of glue. We removed nets and caterpillars just before attaching the paper discs carrying the pupae with a pin needle. Half of the plants for each treatment received five C. glomerata clutches, and the other half received five C. rubecula pupae. The pupae were exposed to the natural community of hyperparasitoids and recollected after 5 d. They were kept separately in 2.2 ml Eppendorf tubes that were closed with cotton wool. The Eppendorf tubes were checked daily for emerging primary parasitoids and hyperparasitoids. All wasps were identified to species level. A completely randomized design was applied to the field studies. Five replications, each with 80 plants (10 replicates of each treatment), were carried out from June until October 2011. To assess hyperparasitism rates and species communities on the solitary and gregarious primary parasitoid, we established plots of 6×6 m containing 49 plants of B. oleracea cultivars in an experimental field in the vicinity of Wageningen, the Netherlands, during 3 consecutive years (2005–2007). Within plots, plants were planted in a square of 7×7 plants with a spacing of 75 cm between plants. Plots were isolated by strips of 6 m wide that were sown with a grass mixture of Lolium and Poa species. During the growth season of cabbage plants, from early May until the end of September, we conducted weekly surveys on the plants for C. glomerata and C. rubecula pupae by investigating both sides of all leaves of all plants in the plots. The pupae were collected and placed individually in 2.2 ml Eppendorf tubes and closed with cotton wool. The pupae with their external silk cocoon were weighed, and for the gregarious C. glomerata, the brood size was determined. The Eppendorf tubes were checked daily for emerging parasitoids, which were individually transferred to another Eppendorf tube and stored at −20°C. All wasps were identified to species level. To characterize the differences in plant volatile release after herbivory by unparasitized and parasitized caterpillars, we collected the headspace of 6-wk-old B. oleracea plants subjected to different herbivore treatments. Dynamic headspace sampling was carried out in a climate room, and we collected 12 replicates of each of four experimental treatments: (1) undamaged plants, plants infested with two P. rapae caterpillars that were either (2) unparasitized or parasitized by (3) C. glomerata or (4) C. rubecula. Caterpillars were allowed to feed for 7 d, during which the parasitoid larvae nearly completed their development inside the herbivore. Prior to volatile collection, caterpillars were removed and plants were removed from their pots. Their roots and soil were carefully wrapped with aluminium foil. During volatile collection, the plants were placed individually into a 25 litre glass jar, which was sealed with a viton-lined glass lid with an inlet and outlet. Compressed air was filtered by passing through charcoal before reaching to the glass jar containing the plant. Volatiles were trapped by sucking air out of the glass jar at a rate of 150 ml min−1 through a stainless steel tube filled with 200 mg Tenax TA (Markes, Llantrisant, UK) for 4 h. A Thermo Trace GC Ultra coupled with Thermo Trace DSQ quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used for separation and detection of plant volatiles. Prior to releasing the volatiles into the GC, the Tenax TA cartridges were dry-purged under a stream of nitrogen (20 ml min−1) for 10 min at ambient temperature in order to remove moisture and oxygen. The collected volatiles were released from the Tenax TA thermally on an Ultra 50:50 thermal desorption unit (Markes, Llantrisant, UK) at 250°C for 10 min under a helium flow of 20 ml min−1, while re-collecting the volatiles in a thermally cooled universal solvent trap at 10°C using Unity (Markes, Llantrisant, UK). Once the desorption process was completed, volatile compounds were released from the cold trap by ballistic heating at a fast rate (40°C s−1) to 280°C and was then kept at 280°C for 10 min, while the volatiles transferred to a ZB-5MSi analytical column (30 m×0.25 mm I.D. ×1.00 µm F.T.; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) in a splitless mode for further separation. The column was operated at an initial temperature of 40°C and the temperature was raised at 5°C min−1 to 280°C and held for 4 min under a column flow of 1 ml min−1 in a constant flow mode. The DSQ mass spectrometer (MS) was operated in a scan mode with a mass range of 35–350 amu at 5.38 scans s−1, and ionization was performed in EI mode at 70 eV. The MS transfer line and ion source were set at 275 and 250°C, respectively. Compound identification was based on comparison of mass spectra with those in the NIST 2005 and Wageningen Mass Spectral Database of Natural Products MS libraries. Experimentally obtained linear retention indices (LRI) were also used as additional measures for confirming the identity of compounds. Relative quantification by peak areas of individual compounds was done using the integrated absolute signal of a quantifier ion in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. The individual peak areas of each compound were computed into peak area per gram shoot biomass to correct for differences in size of individual plants. L. nana preferences for herbivore-induced plant volatiles, as tested in two-choice Y-tube olfactometer assays, were analysed using two-tailed binomial tests. Hyperparasitoid preferences for plant volatiles induced by unparasitized P. rapae caterpillars and caterpillars parasitized by gregarious or solitary primary parasitoids under field conditions were analysed using two Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). To analyse the effects of plant inductions with different types of herbivory on hyperparasitism at plant level, we modelled the dependent variable as a binomial occurrence of hyperparasitism per plant (400 plants equally divided over five replicates) and scored presence of hyperparasitoids in pupae as 1 and absence as 0. Additionally, to test the effects of the plant inductions on hyperparasitism at cocoon level, we modelled the dependent variable as the number of pupae or clutches giving any hyperparasitoid out of the fixed totals of five pupae attached to the plant. Into the two models we included the fixed factors caterpillar induction (undamaged, unparasitized P. rapae, P. rapae parasitized by C. glomerata, and P. rapae parasitized by C. rubecula), replicate (five replications), types of pupae (gregarious or solitary), and the interactions between the three terms. For the field collections of solitary and gregarious pupae (n = 1,668 and 1,256, respectively), we analysed whether the gregarious broods of primary parasitoids were more frequently found by hyperparasitoids than solitary pupae and whether this results in differences in the total fraction of hyperparasitism of primary parasitoid offspring from gregarious and solitary species. First, we tested whether solitary and gregarious pupae of the primary parasitoids differed in the proportion of occasions that these were found by a hyperparasitoid. For each solitary parasitoid, we scored a 1 when there was a hyperparasitoid emerging and a 0 when the primary parasitoid emerged. Because gregarious broods could be hyperparasitized to different degrees (percentage pupae parasitized), which may be a result of a single hyperparasitoid finding the gregarious brood and parasitizing several pupae or a result from multiple occasions on which hyperparasitoids found the gregarious brood, we scored a 1 when any hyperparasitoid emerged from the gregarious Cotesia brood. We used a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to test for the effect of Cotesia species and year as well as their interaction on the binomially distributed occurrence of hyperparasitism. Second, we tested whether hyperparasitoids exert different levels of parasitism of gregarious and solitary primary parasitoids. Within each of the years, for each Cotesia species we counted the total number of emerging wasps for each of the primary parasitoid and hyperparasitoid species. The data on species composition and their abundance per Cotesia species were subjected to Chi-square tests to assess parasitoid community differences for primary parasitoid brood size (solitary or gregarious). One of the hyperparasitoid species (i.e., Baryscapus galactopus) parasitizes the larvae of Cotesia when these are still inside a caterpillar and lay several eggs within a single Cotesia larva. The B. galactopus brood develops when the Cotesia larvae spin their cocoon outside the caterpillar and B. galactopus wasps emerge from the Cotesia pupa. The brood size of B. galactopus on Cotesia is on average eight B. galactopus per Cotesia pupa, and therefore, we recalculated the total incidence of parasitization of Cotesia pupae by dividing the B. galactopus numbers by 8 and rounding off to the nearest whole number (numbers of each parasitoid species are presented in Table 5). All statistical tests were performed with the statistical software package Gen Stat (10th edition). We used Partial Least Squares Projection to Latent Structures-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) to analyse which of the compounds contributed most to describing the difference among plant treatments. The compounds that scored >1 in their Variable Importance in the Projection (VIP) scores were subjected to Mann–Whitney U tests among treatment pairs to test for significant differences among treatments.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:46:05.970-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:46:05.970-0400" } } ] },{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "54158e132c243f028874ccf8" }, "title" : "Sandra Fluke nominated by Time magazine for Person of the Year", "articles" : [ { "ext_url" : "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/peter-roff/2012/11/29/gop-cant-dismiss-times-sandra-fluke-person-of-the-year-nod", "title" : "GOP Can't Dismiss Time's Sandra Fluke Person of the Year Nod", "text" : "Conservatives are very much in arms over the news that Sandra Fluke, she of the uber-expensive birth control problem, is under consideration to be Time's Person of the Year.\n\nActually, the magazine—even in considering her—has a point, since the award is supposed to go to the person or person who had the biggest influence on the events of the day over the previous year. As the anchor for the liberals' \"war on women\" attack against Mitt Romney and the GOP, she can arguably be called the public face of the issue that helped turn the election.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the Catholic contraception controversy.]\n\nIn hindsight, the Republicans didn't realize what was up, at least not until it was too late. The claims made by Ms. Fluke and others regarding the issue of birth control were, to most Americans, so outrageous as to be, if not unbelievable at least wide-open to parody and ridicule—except for a subgroup of women, especially those of college age or in graduate school. They struck right at the heart of what their professors and campus organizations had been telling them about the Republicans: that they hate women, regard them as second-class citizens and baby factories, and do not take them seriously. The media echo chamber's repetition of the comments made by some Republicans and some commentators about Ms. Fluke only helped reinforce that view—which hurt because this election, for Obama, was not about turning out as many American to vote as possible. It was about turning out, in higher numbers than the GOP expected, the right kinds of Americans, meaning those who would vote for Obama.\n\nThat may sound like a study of the obvious but Obama and the Democrats spent a lot of time and money to make it happen. The idea that the GOP was engaged in a \"war on women\" resonated with younger Obama voters and helped drive them to the polls on Election Day.\n\n[Read the U.S. News Debate: Is There a Republican 'War on Women'?]\n\nMoving forward, the GOP has a lot to do to repair the damage caused by the allegation that there was a \"war on women.\" This does not mean, however, that they should move left. Electing Washington State Rep. Cathy McMorris Rogers to lead the House Republican Conference is a smart move, as is making Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn vice chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. It will be important in the days and weeks ahead for the party to give its women elected officials—including New Mexico Gov. Susanna Martinez, New Hampshire Sen.

I'm always curious who is nominated and of course, like many, who winds up on the cover and is chosen as the \"Person of the Year.\" The criteria to be chosen, according to Time, is: \"the person or persons who most affected the news and our lives, for good or ill, and embodied what was important about the year.\"\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the Catholic contraception controversy.]\n\nMany talk show hosts, pundits, and bloggers have balked at Fluke being included on a list that also boasts the names of President Obama and Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn a post on his Gateway Pundit blog, Jim Hoft wrote that Time \"nominated Sandra Fluke, the Georgetown law student who demanded you pay for her $10 a month birth control pills, as person of the year.\" Hoft wrote that the nomination \"will put her up there with Adolf Hitler and Yasser Arafat.\" And Breitbart blogger Ben Shapiro wrote: \"Just when you think Time magazine can't make any more of a mockery of itself, they nominate Sandra Fluke.\"\n\nI disagree wholeheartedly with Hoft, Shapiro and others on the right who don't feel Fluke's name belongs on that list. In nominating her, Time cited her advocacy for women's rights, her \"poise and maturity\" in dealing with attacks from the right-wing media, and her influence on promoting reproductive rights as a key issue in the presidential campaign.\n\n[Read the U.S. News Debate: Should Catholic and Other Religious Institutions Have to Cover Birth Control?]\n\nAnd in case you've forgotten, some of those attacks by the media included remarks such as these, from conservative talker Rush Limbaugh:\n\nWhat does it say about the college coed Susan [sic] Fluke who goes before a congressional committee and essentially says that she must be paid to have sex. What does that make her? It makes her a slut, right? It makes her a prostitute. She wants to be paid to have sex.\n\nShe's having so much sex, she can't afford the contraception. She wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex. What does that make us? We're the pimps.\n\nCan you imagine if you're her parents how proud of Sandra Fluke you would be? Your daughter goes up to a congressional hearing conducted by the Botox-filled Nancy Pelosi and testifies she's having so much sex she can't afford her own birth control pills and she agrees that Obama should provide them, or the Pope.\n\nAnd the right wing media attacked this woman; personally for months on end.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the Republican Party.]\n\nAlthough I agree with Time's decision to place Fluke on this list, I also believe she belongs on the list for bringing the issue of the \"War on Women\" to the forefront of America's minds. She should be credited with reminding women on both the right and the left; that many of us agree on the issue of women's reproductive rights. Although some of us might be Democrats and some Republicans, our gender unites us. She brought more women to the polls, reminding us of the decades it took to be where we are and what was at stake for women if we did not re-elect President Obama. In speaking at the Democratic National Convention, she showed true strength over adversity. And she has since become a women's health activist. For these reasons alone, she belongs on this list.\n\nAnd I wonder why Hoft, Shapiro, and others on the right haven't been outraged by some other names on the list: Jon Stewart? Korean rapper Psy?

When I saw articles on the other foreign sites like Huffington Post and Gawker I thought it was really cool. But when I saw the CNN video, I actually thought the video wasn’t real! I thought someone had edited it as a joke.\n\nCNNGo: Where did you find that little boy in the video? He’s hysterical.\n\nPSY: Isn’t he great? His name is Hwang Min-woo and he’s five. The night before the music video shoot, I was watching Korea’s Got Talent and saw him dance to Michael Jackson. His moves were ridiculous. So we called him up and asked him to be in the music video, which was shooting the very next day, and he came and it all worked out.\n\nCNNGo: What is your favorite song off this album? ‘What If,’ with Lena Park is great.\n\nPSY: I’ve noticed that a lot of women in their 20s and 30s really like that song!

Robbie Williams, T-Pain … But actually the biggest influence in my music, especially when I was starting out, was Queen. I know that’s probably surprising, but you’ll know if you’ve ever been to one of my concerts that I love to emulate their style when I’m performing live.

The Tar Sands Blockade group has staged a number of high-profile blockades in East Texas, where the southern leg of the pipeline is being constructed, but this was the very first blockade to enter the pipeline and involved extreme risk to the participants. As a Tar Sands Blockade release explained:\n\nUsing a blockading technique never implemented before, Matt Almonte and Glen Collins locked themselves between two barrels of concrete weighing over six hundred pounds each. Located twenty-five feet into a pipe segment waiting to be laid in the ground, the outer barrel is barricading the pipe’s opening and neither barrel can be moved without risking serious injury to the blockaders.\n\nAs Salon reported last month, President Obama had delayed deciding on the stalled pipeline extension until after the election, but must now consider whether to approve the TransCanada-owned pipe, which would carry crude oil from Alberta’s tar sands to the Gulf Coast, while — according to opponents — producing lethal levels of carbon emissions, uprooting communities and lining the pockets of oil magnates the Koch brothers. Obama is highly likely to eventually approve the pipeline but not until early 2013 at the earliest.\n\nIn the meantime, the Tar Sands Blockade group continue to build support and protest the Keystone XL’s southern leg with escalating intensity. Police struggled to extract the blockaders for sometime Monday, according to updates from the group:\n\nUPDATE: 12:05 pm – Two police officers enter the pipe, emerge a few minutes later Glen and Matt are still locked inside the pipe; the police have been completely unable to extract them but continue to threaten various extraction techniques which would endanger the blockaders’ lives, such as cutting into the pipe. Join the fight against Keystone XL by coming to our next Mass Action Camp starting on January 3, one month from today! Police brought an ambulance to the scene and then began pulling on one of the barrels. The crowd surged onto the easement to protect Glen and Matt from this dangerous extraction, but they were chased away by the police. Both barrels and the two blockaders have been removed from the pipe.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:47:35.038-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:47:35.038-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/18/nation/la-na-keystone-20120119", "title" : "Obama administration denies Keystone XL oil pipeline permit", "text" : "The State Department says it needs more time to assess the proposal under current law. Project advocates and opponents both are likely to prolong the political fight.\n\nFor environmentalists and many other Democratic constituencies, the administration's willingness to deny the permit has become a test of whether Obama has the resolve to stand up to big business.\n\nFor Republicans, the oil industry and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Keystone has become a one-word campaign slogan: synonymous with the themes of regulatory overreach and environmental activism they have tried to pin on President Obama.\n\nThe State Department, responding to a 60-day deadline Congress imposed in late December, said Wednesday that it did not \"have sufficient time to obtain the information necessary to assess whether the project, in its current state, is in the national interest.\"\n\nReporting from Washington — The Obama administration denied a permit for the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada, leaving the door open for the builder to reapply this year but prolonging a bitter political fight that has raged for months and energized each party's political base.\n\nAs a result, the fight over the pipeline has become one of those battles that each side finds useful, and both are likely to prolong it.\n\nThe State Department said that TransCanada Corp., the company seeking to build the 1,700-mile pipeline to carry heavy crude oil to Gulf Coast refineries, is free to reapply for a permit using a new, and presumably less environmentally sensitive, route. Officials in Nebraska are expected to identify possible alternative routes in coming weeks that would allow the pipeline to circumvent the Ogallala aquifer, the main source of drinking water in the Midwest.\n\nIn November, the administration delayed what seemed an imminent decision on the pipeline until early 2013, allowing Obama to sidestep a potentially explosive issue during a tough reelection campaign. The decision Wednesday comes in response to the deadline Congress imposed as part of a deal to extend a payroll-tax break and unemployment benefits for two months.\n\nThe permit's denial makes official what the administration has said from the outset: that under current law, it cannot accelerate the permitting process, especially in light of the need for additional environmental reviews of a new path.\n\n\"This announcement is not a judgment on the merits of the pipeline, but the arbitrary nature of a deadline that prevented the State Department from gathering the information necessary to approve the project and protect the American people,\" Obama said.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, an ardent proponent of Keystone XL, \"expressed his profound disappointment with the news. He indicated to President Obama that he hoped that this project would continue,\" according to a statement from the prime minister's office.\n\nTransCanada said that it planned to reapply for a new route in hopes of getting an expedited review based on the assessments done so far and putting the pipeline into operation in late 2014. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Kerri-Ann Jones said it was too early to say whether TransCanada would go through an expedited process when it reapplied.\n\n\"They will have to go through all the requirements needed for the permit,\" Jones said. \"We do have guidelines to use the information that is already out there, but we would have to look at this as a completely new application.\"\n\nCongressional Republicans and conservative Democrats, the oil industry, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and construction workers unions decried the decision. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said the decision was another example of how Obama's policies were making the American economy worse.\n\n\"The president is selling out American jobs for politics,\" Boehner said.\n\nDemocrats facing tough Senate races in conservative-leaning states also criticized the move.\n\n\"I am disappointed in the president's decision,\" said Sen. Jon Tester of Montana. \"I have long supported responsibly building this pipeline with the highest safety standards and with respect for private property rights.\"", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:47:37.709-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:47:37.709-0400" } } ] },{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "54158e6e2c243f028874ccfd" }, "title" : "Australian Paralympian Janet Shaw dies aged 46", "articles" : [ { "ext_url" : "http://www.sportingwheelies.org.au/news/346-vale-peter-marsh", "title" : "Vale Peter Marsh", "text" : "27/11/12 \n\nOne of the Association’s founding members and early Paralympians, wheelchair athlete Peter Marsh, sadly passed away in Brisbane yesterday aged 64.\n\nPeter was playing for Wests rugby league club in Brisbane in 1970 when he was injured in a tackle and spent 10 months at Princess Alexandra Hospital’s spinal unit learning to cope with life as a quadriplegic.\n\nHe quickly became involved in track events and table tennis and began a successful career in competitive sport that spanned 15 years, including representing Australia at world championships and the Paralympic Games in 1976, 1980 and 1984.\n\nOff the track, Peter volunteered his time and expertise to help drive the development of disability sport, and particularly sport for people with quadriplegia, in Queensland and Australia.

A change in the weather is on its way. But it may take some time.\n\nThe National Weather Service's office in Grand Junction predicts that a few minor storms may roll through northwest Colorado starting about the evening of Dec. 5. But the real chance of snow - and, crucially, cooler temperatures - won't come until the week of Dec. 10.\n\nTravis Booth, a forecaster in the National Weather Service's Grand Junction office, said some \"minor disturbances\" will flow through the region later this week, but those storms will more closely resemble Monday morning's showers, with a bit of snow in the upper valley and rain in Gypsum.\n\n\"Farther out there's some promise,\" Booth said. \"The models have been inconsistent, but they do agree there should be a push of cold air.\"\n\nMeteorologist Joel Gratz of OpenSnow.com said the reasons for the change are complex - weather everywhere is interconnected, he said - but the most simple explanation is that the \"jet stream,\" a flow of air in the upper atmosphere, is shifting to the south. Generally, when the jet stream is tracking to the north, areas to the south stay fairly dry and brown - like the late fall we've had so far. When the jet stream drops to the south, so do the storms. This time of year, that means at least some snow.\n\nBooth said one of the reasons the jet stream has stayed north is that it has been influenced by a persistent low pressure system in the Gulf of Alaska. That low is expected to change to high pressure, which will push the storm track to the south, and much closer to Colorado. When that happens, temperatures drop, so what snow does fall is more likely to stick, at least for a while.\n\nThis big question, of course, is whether the storm track will bring feet of white, fluffy powder, a few inches of cement, or something in between? No one knows.\n\nWhile weather forecasting has become pretty accurate in the short-term, long-term forecasting is still a matter of watching, and history.\n\n\"You're looking for trends and consistency between the models,\" Booth said. \"In this case, the models have been consistent, and are trending in the same direction.\"\n\nIn this case, forecasters look for high pressure developing over the Pacific between roughly California and Hawaii. Big, persistent areas of high or low pressure can give forecasters a general idea of what's coming.\n\nIn this case, the high pressure should start delivering at least some snow to the Rockies, most likely before Christmas.\n\n\"That doesn't guarantee snow - nobody can do that,\" Gratz said. \"But by the later part of the month, people should feel better.\"\n\nAnd, of course, snow over the rest of the winter should allow people to feel better about making lemonade, flushing toilets or watering flowers when winter fades into spring and summer next year.\n\nBusiness Editor Scott N.

But the rest of December isn't as cheerful, and that has some in the valley worried.\"Right now, we're at 30 (percent) to 40 percent, at best, for the week before Christmas,\" Antlers Lodge General Manager Rob LeVine said.In normal years, LeVine said the Antlers would be 80 percent booked, or more, in that week at rates nearly equal to those charged during Christmas week.Tommy Hoffman, owner of Rocky Mountain Vacation Rentals, said his business is up, just slightly, for the end of the year. And, he added, he's heard stories of other lodges' reservations being down, and significantly, from last year.LeVine, for one, isn't terribly worried. At least not yet.For one thing, there really isn't anything anyone can do about snow levels. We can all do snow dances, take our snow tires back off or, for those so inclined, pray. The skies will bring snow when it happens to come.\n\nBut the calendar - which puts Christmas and New Year's Day on Tuesdays - may have more to do with lighter reservation numbers this year than the weather.The Eagle County School District's \"holiday break\" starts Dec. 24, and kids' last day of school is Dec. 20. School starts again Jan. 7. Most schools are following a similar holiday schedule. Vail Valley Partnership Executive Director Chris Romer said having kids in school until the weekend before Christmas will, by definition, put a brake on reservations the week before.\"It's always this way when those holidays fall on a Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday,\" Romer said. Since the Partnership is one of the valley's main reservation services, Romer gets to see reservation numbers for the coming weeks and months. He acknowledged that reservations for the week before Christmas are pacing behind last year. But, he added, the pace of reservations for the last week of December is actually running ahead of last year's numbers. January reservations are \"OK,\" Romer said, and February and March are \"fine.\"Steve Virostek runs Triumph Mountain Properties. Part of that company's business is vacation rentals, with about 40 units available. He said that part of the operation is running well right now.\"We're up over 200 percent over last year,\" Virostek said. \"We've had a couple of early cancelations, but that's it.\"\n\nThe long-term rental market - rentals for at least several months - seems to be strong, too.Onie Bolduc, of Bold Property Solutions - an Avon-based real estate and property-management company - said his company has fewer vacancies for this season than the previous couple. That's a sign of an improving real estate market, which has been reflected in the number of sales so far this year.Bolduc, who grew up in the valley, said he understands the snow anxiety in the valley but isn't worried just yet. \"We've had Thanksgiving without snow a lot ... and we haven't had a lot of World Cup races with the whole mountain open,\" he said.LeVine has spent most of his life in the valley, too. He said there's still time for snow to have an effect on the holiday season.\"If we get some significant snow in the next week or two, that'll help,\" LeVine said. \"If it's past (Dec. 15), it won't really help us. ... Even the people who wait, at some point, will say, 'We're going somewhere.'\" Every day that goes by without snow, we lose some of that business.\"Everyone wants snow, of course, but Virostek said that Vail had a record month for sales tax in December of last year, when Vail Mountain hadn't yet opened the Back Bowls. That, he believes, is thanks to Vail's decade-long renovation, which put a lot more amenities into the town.And there are still people who own vacation property in Vail or Beaver Creek who will come to the valley for their holiday celebrations. But that group is a relatively small part of the total crowd the valley hopes to host at the end of the year. Rich tenBraak, executive director of the Vail Chamber & Business Association, said that group still shops and dines but doesn't pay lodging tax, which will show up on town and county balance sheets. But people are coming for the holidays, no matter how white this Christmas may end up.\"I had a client email me from Mexico this morning asking whether she should cancel ski school for her kids,\" Bolduc said. \"She didn't say she wasn't coming, just whether to cancel ski school. People will be here, and if they can't ski, they're going to the movies or out shopping.\"So (snow) is concerning, but it's not a concern.\"Business Editor Scott N.

Morsi had left the complex through a back gate the night before as tens of thousands of protesters pushed through a barricade and approached the palace. Officials say the president used an exit he routinely uses and left at the end of his working day.\n\nAt one point during the protest, police fired tear gas at the crowd.

After a brief calm on Wednesday night, fighting extended into the early morning with fires burning in the streets where\n\nthe opposing sides threw stones and petrol bombs at each other. \"No to dictatorship,\" Morsi's opponents chanted, while their rivals chanted: \"Defending Morsi is defending Islam.\" A small group of opposition activists have been camped outside the palace since Tuesday night, when tens of thousands rallied against a controversial decree which gives Morsi near-absolute power. Supporters of the president marched to the palace on Wednesday and tore down the opposition's tents. Witnesses said they threw stones and used clubs to attack demonstrators. Opposition protesters were driven away from the palace and fled down side streets. Thirty-two people were arrested, according to a statement from the interior ministry. Protests spread to other cities, and offices of Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood in Ismailia and Suez were torched. Both sides blamed the other for starting the clashes: Opposition leaders said Morsi was responsible for the bloodshed, while senior Brotherhood officials accused the opposition of \"inciting violence\". Morsi did not make any public appearances on Wednesday, but his prime minister, Hisham Qandil, issued a brief statement calling for calm \"to give the opportunity for the efforts being made now to begin a national dialogue\". The violence escalates a two-week-old political standoff in Egypt, which began with Morsi's November 22 decree, which shielded his decisions from judicial oversight. Hours after the clashes began, a spokesman for the Brotherhood called on protesters to leave. Mahmoud Ghozlan said both sides should \"withdraw at the same time and pledge not to return there, given the symbolism of the palace\". Al Jazeera's Sherine Tadros, reporting from Cairo, said the main message now was a call for dialogue. \"What's really significant and saddening, and very worrying for a lot of people in this country watching their TV screens, is that these are Egyptian civilians fighting Egyptian civilians,\" she said. \"The country is so divided and polarised. That has been the situation for many months, but it was made all the more intense two weeks ago when Morsi issued this constitutional decree giving himself sweeping powers.\" The crisis continues to divide Morsi's government. Four of Morsi's advisers resigned in protest on Wednesday. Saif Abdelfattah, one of the president's political advisers, quit during a live interview with Al Jazeera, blaming the \"mummified\" political culture in Egypt for his departure. Two other top Morsi aides resigned last week, including Samir Morcos, a prominent Coptic Christian scholar. The decree issued by Morsi barred the courts from dissolving the controversial 100-member constituent assembly which has been drafting a new constitution. A final draft of the document was sent to Morsi last week, and it is scheduled to face a public referendum on December 15. While protesters battled outside, Vice President Mahmoud Mekki held a news conference inside the palace and tried to calm the situation. He urged the opposition to rein in street protests, and said political groups could agree on a plan to amend contentious articles after a new parliament is elected in 2013. He called for \"communication between political forces\" on the document. \"There must be consensus,\" he said. \"There is real political will to pass the current period and respond to the demands of the public.\" A group of prominent opposition leaders, including Mohamed ElBaradei, Hamdeen Sabbahi and Amr Moussa, held a press conference in Cairo on Wednesday night and dismissed Mekki's offer. ElBaradei said the opposition is open to dialogue, but not until Morsi revokes his decree. All three men blamed Morsi for the violence outside the presidential palace. \"He has lost the moral legitimacy to lead Egypt,\" said Sabbahi, who placed third in the presidential election earlier this year. But the Muslim Brotherhood quickly turned around and blamed their opponents for the clashes. Gehad el-Haddad, a senior adviser to the Freedom and Justice Party, accused the three opposition leaders of \"inciting violence\". \"It's very sad to see opposition leaders such as ElBaradei, Hamdeen and Amr Moussa to resort to such levels of talk,\" he told Al Jazeera. \"Such disrespect to the sanctity of peaceful protesting, within the context of democracy, is very alarming.\"", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:48:07.521-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:48:07.521-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.presstv.com/detail/2012/12/05/276380/two-dead-in-cairo-clashes-elbaradei/", "title" : "Two people die in Cairo clashes between Morsi supporters, opponents", "text" : "Two people die in Cairo clashes between Morsi supporters, opponents\n\nEgypt's prominent opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei says at least two people have died after clashes between President Mohamed Morsiâs supporters and opponents turned violent outside the presidential palace.\n\nHe added that the Egyptian opposition is prepared for negotiations if Morsiâs controversial decree is cancelled, adding that the North African countryâs regime is losing legitimacy every day.MKA/SS", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:48:09.287-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:48:09.287-0400" } } ] },{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "54158e8c2c243f028874cd01" }, "title" : "Sandra Fluke gives keynote speech at Nebraska women's health event", "articles" : [ { "ext_url" : "http://www.dailynebraskan.com/news/article_bb77c1ae-3e99-11e2-ac0c-001a4bcf6878.html", "title" : "FLUKE: âItâs time for young women in this country to join the fightâ", "text" : "This year has brought many changes and milestones for womenâs issues and women in politics, said Sandra Fluke, American attorney and womenâs rights activist. Fluke was the keynote speaker for Planned Parenthood of the Heartlandâs annual fundraiser Tuesday night called âThe Big Event: Courage â No Matter What.â\n\nHundreds of people gathered at the Rococo Theatre to support Planned Parenthood and listen to Fluke speak. About 20 protesters stood in a line on the sidewalk outside, holding anti-abortion signs and singing Christmas carols.\n\nFluke recently came into the public eye when conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh made derogatory statements toward her because of her support for health insurance coverage of contraceptive costs. She was among the top 40 candidates for Time magazineâs person of the year, publicly supported the Obama campaign and was a speaker at the 2012 Democratic National Convention.\n\nâShe is definitely the biggest person weâve had in a long time,â said Emily Schiltz, Planned Parenthood intern and sophomore political science major at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Schiltz said she was excited to hear such a high-profile speaker.\n\nFlukeâs talk focused on womenâs health, the affordable care act and making a difference.\n\nâShe is a wonderfully outspoken person on the affordable care act, womenâs health and womenâs rights,â said Susan Allen, Nebraska communications manager part for Planned Parenthood of the Heartland. âWe decided she would be the perfect person to speak to Planned Parenthood supporters.â\n\nFluke said this year has been âbizarre,â with all of the changes involving womenâs health and womenâs rights.\n\nâThis year, something changed in our national conversation about womenâs health,â she said.\n\nIn this yearâs election, standing up for womenâs reproductive health almost felt like an electoral requirement for candidates, Fluke said, as the issue has become more prominent.\n\nâBefore my time, womenâs healthcare has never decided a presidential election,â Fluke said. âWe really did make a difference this election.â\n\nFreshman journalism major and Planned Parenthood intern Audrey Nance was most excited to hear from Fluke about what others can do to make a difference in womenâs issues.\n\nâI feel like she walks the walk rather than talk the talk,â Nance said.\n\nFluke said she âfelt badâ after hearing Limbaughâs comments, but she worked to overcome them.\n\nâWhen I first heard the comments, I was primarily concerned about my parents and family,â Fluke said. âI wanted them to hear from me about what happened. It was a misogynistic attack to try to silence women.â\n\nThough Fluke was publicly embarrassed, she didnât let the controversy stop her from fighting for her beliefs.\n\nâThe way I looked at it, I had an opportunity,â she said.\n\nThroughout her speech, Fluke encouraged the audience to get involved in womenâs issues.\n\nâItâs time for young women in this country to join the fight, because itâs our rights and our health that are at stake,â she said.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:48:10.160-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:48:10.160-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/29/six-reasons-we-adore-sand_n_2211553.html", "title" : "Sandra Fluke 'TIME's' Person Of The Year?

She testified in front of House Democrats arguing that religiously-affiliated institutions' health insurance plans for employees and students should be required to cover birth control.\n\nHowever, Fluke has also won the support of women around the country, from celebrities like Martha Plimpton to college students.\n\nAt HuffPost Women, we're in the latter camp. To celebrate Fluke's TIME nomination, we've complied six reasons to love Sandra Fluke:\n\n1. She is one of the only people Rush Limbaugh has ever apologized to -- and she rejected it.\n\n2. She champions other women. When HuffPost Women asked Fluke at the 2012 Glamour Women of the Year Awards how she was brave enough to do what she did, she answered:\n\n\"What I did doesn't compare to what either [Ruth Bader Ginsburg or Zaha Hadid] did. But what I find amazing -- I was thinking about Erin [Merryn], the awardee that stepped forward and talked about the abuse that she had suffered and has done so much for young girls and young boys as well that makes it possible for them to come forward and talk about it. It just exemplifies what we can all do. We can all step forward and face what we're afraid of, and people will support us when we do that. It’s so amazing to see so many women tonight who have done that.\"\n\n3. She is willing to cross political lines for what she believes is right. When Clueless actress Stacey Dash tweeted an endorsement of Mitt Romney only to be met with racist attacks, Fluke defended Dash:\n\n4. Did we mention she's gracious? When she got engaged to her long-term boyfriend in the aftermath of her testimony and Limbaugh's attack, she told the Daily Beast that, \"having dated for over eight years, we're just excited that our friends and family were kind enough to pretend to be surprised at our engagement. We're really looking forward to spending the next eight years planning our wedding.\"\n\n5. Despite all the attention, she remains accessible. She has a Tumblr where she allows fans to ask her anything. She also posts personal anecdotes she receives on how important access to affordable birth control is for women.\n\n6.

Seven people were killed, and more than 770 injured, during hours of clashes outside the presidential palace on Wednesday. Supporters of the president attacked a group of opposition protesters staging a peaceful sit-in outside the palace, using firebombs, clubs and guns, according to witnesses. In his speech, Morsi called the violence \"regrettable,\" and blamed it on \"infiltrators\" funded by unnamed third parties. \"Such painful events happened because of political differences that should be resolved through dialogue,\" he said. His speech, still ongoing, comes amidst ongoing unrest in the Egyptian capital. At least five tanks were deployed outside the palace on Thursday, according to the army. The state news agency said the military deployment was to \"secure\" the building. Nine armoured troop carriers were also reported on the street outside the palace. The violence that had stretched from Wednesday afternoon into the early hours of Thursday had abated by morning, and the streets were calm. The soldiers were members of the Republican Guard, whose duties include protecting the president and his offices. \"The Republican Guard began a deployment around the headquarters of the presidency ... to secure the headquarters of the presidency in its capacity as a symbol of the state and the official headquarters of government,\" the agency reported. Yet violence had picked up again by Thursday afternoon as the opposing sides began throwing stones at each other, despite the military presence. The fighting erupted late on Wednesday afternoon when thousands of Morsi's supporters descended on an area near the presidential palace where about 300 of his opponents were staging a sit-in. Members of Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood chased the protesters away from their base outside the palace's main gate and tore down their tents. After a brief lull, hundreds of Morsi opponents arrived and began throwing firebombs at the president's backers, who responded with rocks. The deployment of hundreds of riot police did not stop the fighting. The police later fired tear gas to disperse Morsi's opponents. Egypt's top Islamic body also called on the president to suspend his constitutional decree, and demanded unconditional dialogue between Morsi and his opponents. Al-Azhar said Morsi should \"suspend the latest decree and stop using it,\" in a statement issued on Thursday. Morsi, for his part, seemed to be pressing relentlessly forward with plans for a December 15 constitutional referendum to pass the new charter. A prominent Christian said he had resigned from his role as an aide to President Morsi and a senior official in the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party. \"I have decided to retire from any political work and to withdraw from any political role ... including withdrawing from any role in the presidency and the Freedom and Justice Party,\" Rafik Habib said in a statement on his official Facebook page. It was not immediately clear from the statement what had prompted Habib to step down. Compounding Morsi's woes, four of his advisers resigned on Wednesday, joining three other members of his 17-member advisory panel who have abandoned him since the crisis began. The large scale and intensity of the fighting marked a milestone in Egypt's deepening schism, pitting the Brotherhood and ultra-conservative Islamists in one camp, against liberals, leftists and Christians in the other. The violence spread to other parts of the country on Wednesday. Anti-Morsi protesters stormed and set ablaze the Brotherhood offices in Suez and Ismailia, east of Cairo, and there were clashes in the industrial city of Mahallah and the province of Menoufiyah in the Nile Delta north of the capital. There were rival demonstrations outside the Brotherhood's headquarters in the Cairo suburb of Moqatam and in Alexandria, security officials said senior Brotherhood official Sobhi Saleh was hospitalised after being severely beaten by Morsi's opponents. The opposition is demanding that Morsi rescind the decrees giving him nearly unrestricted powers and shelve the controversial draft constitution, which the president's Islamist allies rushed through last week in a marathon, all-night session shown live on state TV. Mohamed ElBaradei, a leading opposition reform advocate, said late on Wednesday that Morsi's rule was \"no different\" than Mubarak's. \"In fact, it is perhaps even worse,\" the Nobel Peace Prize laureate told a news conference after he accused the president's supporters of a \"vicious and deliberate\" attack on peaceful demonstrators outside the palace.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:48:13.498-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:48:13.498-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/06/us-egypt-politics-tanks-idUSBRE8B508W20121206", "title" : "Tanks outside Mursi's palace, streets calm", "text" : "1 of 2.

It violates freedoms and was only created by the Brotherhood and Salafists for their own benefit,\" said Hanan Sabri, a housewife, as she walked to Tahrir Square, the site of mass protests against the recently issued draft constitution.\n\nThe Constituent Assembly, which wrote the draft charter, is accused of having been dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood – from which President Morsi hails – and Salafist groups. The assembly has also been marred by several withdrawals, including by representatives of the Coptic Church, labourers, journalists and farmers.\n\nThe draft constitution itself is seen by critics as unrepresentative of Egyptians at large and as falling short on the freedoms and social benefits called for in the 25 January Revolution. Many articles are also criticised for being vague.\n\n\"There is an article that states that society should be 'self-critical.' What does that mean? It means that we’ll find people bothering us for not liking what we wear,\" added Sabri.\n\nThe draft constitution was rushed through in a final marathon session during which it was approved by assembly members, cutting short an additional two-month period set aside for discussion of its contents. Morsi was then presented with the document, after which he announced it would be put to a nationwide referendum on 15 December.\n\nThousands gathered in Tahrir Square on Tuesday while hundreds of thousands made their way to the presidential palace in Cairo's Heliopolis district to voice opposition to the draft charter.\n\nTwo major marches from the Abassiya and Madinet Nasr districts close to Heliopolis brought the bulk of protests to the door of the palace. Another rally from Ain Shams University merged with a rally from Rabaa Al-Adawaiya.\n\nThe marches began at 4pm and maintained a peaceful nature, with protesters chanting 'Down with Morsi, down with the rule of the Supreme Guide,' as they snaked through the streets leading to the palace.\n\nAmany Moussa – walking in the Madinet Nasr rally, which was launched from the Rabaa El Adaweya Mosque – complained that Egypt had finally seen some stability in recent months, but Morsi’s constitutional decree had again led to violence.\n\nBefore a date for the constitutional referendum was set, the president had issued a constitutional declaration that shields his decisions from judicial oversight and protects the Constituent Assembly and Shura Council from dissolution by court order.\n\nThe declaration was deemed \"dictatorial\" by the opposition, which filled Tahrir Square twice in protests last week.\n\nIslamist forces then held a rival protest on Saturday in defence of Morsi's decree. Dubbed the \"Day of Legitimacy and Sharia,\" hundreds of thousands of Islamists gathered at Cairo University to back the president.\n\n\"I know he's an elected president, but I think he lost his legitimacy,\" Moussa said.\n\n\"There are various articles in the constitution that violate the values of the Egyptian revolution, especially articles allowing civilians to be put on trial in military courts,\" she said.\n\n\"This is the first time I join a protest,\" Ahmed Ibrahim, another protester at the rally, told Ahram Online. \"I am so angry, I feel that the Muslim Brotherhood are dominating everything and taking complete control of the country.\"\n\nParticipating in the Abassiya march that set out from Cairo's Al-Nour Mosque, Shaimaa – an independent activist in her twenties – travelled from Suez to join the march to denounce Morsi's constitutional declaration.\n\n\"We are here to attend the protest; we’ve taken part in all major protests happening in Cairo since the 25 January Revolution,\" she said, as she arrived with thousands of others in the vicinity of the presidential palace.\n\nLike Ibrahim, Shaimaa condemned the recently finalised draft constitution as being \"a constitution made only for the Muslim Brotherhood.\"\n\n \n\n Shaimaa added that she came only to protest peacefully, but intended to stay if any protesters were assaulted.\n\nAs protesters reached the presidential palace, they were met with a cordon of barbed wire and security personnel. A few minutes later, teargas was fired from the security side, although soldiers later retreated, opening the way in Merghany Street for protesters to pass.\n\nAs they approached the main gate, protesters chanted, \"The people want to topple the regime,\" and, \"We will not leave, he will leave.\"\n\n\"Down with the Supreme Guide [of the Muslim Brotherhood],\" they yelled, while waving Egyptian flags and banners that read: \"We reject splitting the country in two using religion,\" and, \"We reject the constitutional declaration.\"\n\nProtesters also waved flags bearing the images of slain protesters, including Sheikh Emad Effat – who died during clashes between military police and protesters during a December 2011 sit-in – and Sayid Belal, a Salafist activist tortured to death in 2010 under the ousted Mubarak regime.\n\nChallenges face the looming constitutional referendum, as Egypt's Judges Club announced it would boycott the poll – and refrain from supervising polling stations as it usually does – to protest what it calls Morsi's \"power grab\" decree, which they say impinges on its independence.\n\nIn reaction to the Judges Club stance, Egypt's Supreme Judicial Council announced on Monday that it would allocate judges and members of the prosecution to supervise the referendum despite the strike action.\n\nTuesday evening also witnessed protests in Alexandria, Mansoura, Mahalla, Hurghada, Luxor, Assiut, Minya and Ismailia against the draft constitution and constitutional declaration.

The group's pretty stung by what happened tonight, you can't walk away from tonight and think everything's OK.\n\n''But with the personnel we've got, it's certainly fixable.''\n\nForward Brigitte Ardossi (21 points, nine rebounds, two assists), clearly Canberra's best all year, was one of the few Capitals to leave the Harbour City with her reputation intact.\n\nOn their current form, not even the possible injection of Opals superstar Lauren Jackson into their line-up may be enough to salvage the Capitals' campaign.\n\nJackson is yet to take to the court this season and won't before Christmas at a minimum as she continues rehabilitation on a chronic hamstring injury.\n\nWatching Friday night's debacle would have only added to her frustration, but the reality is the Capitals need to find a way to save their season without her.\n\nCanberra (5-7) is now two games behind fourth-placed Bulleen after the Boomers (7-6) humbled cellar-dwellars West Coast 73-52 on Friday night.\n\nBefore last season, when they finished eighth, the Capitals hadn't missed the play-offs since 2004-05.\n\nNext week the dreaded 'Doomsday Double' road trip awaits, West Coast on Friday night and third-placed Adelaide on Sunday.\n\nHopefully the soul-searching which unfolds in Capitals camp this week does the trick, because two losses would end any realistic hope of making the finals.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:48:25.700-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:48:25.700-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.canberratimes.com.au/sport/basketball/share-graf-as-needed-says-stirling-20121206-2aymw.html", "title" : "Share Graf as needed, says Stirling", "text" : "Former Australian Opals coach Jan Stirling says asking Carrie Graf to give up her Canberra Capitals post in world championship or Olympic years is an option Basketball Australia could consider as its post-Olympic review continues.\n\nStirling suggested a number of options that could be discussed, with the sport's governing body weighing up whether the position should be full-time.\n\nAs did Graf, Stirling juggled a club head coaching post with the national job with great success. She guided the Opals to Olympic silver medals in 2004 and 2008, and also masterminded four WNBL championships with Adelaide Lightning.\n\nStirling quit the Lightning in 2004 to concentrate on the Opals, but insisted Graf, her successor, did not have to follow suit.\n\nStirling, lauded by many as Australia's most successful coach, said installing the Opals coach as head of a centre of excellence, instead of coaching a WNBL club, could also be an option.\n\nGraf's Capitals and Opals contracts expire at the end of the season.\n\n''One thing they could do is 'Graffy' gets her four-year [Opals] appointment and can still coach the Capitals,'' Stirling said. ''However, in 2014, the world championship year, there's an an expectation Graffy is full-time with the Opals from January 1, therefore she wouldn't be head coach of the Capitals.\n\n''In the critical [Olympics and world championship] years, from January 1 to September 30, you're full-time.\n\n''Do we need to look at hypothetically a centre of excellence, and the head coach is there exposing the second tier to their ethos?\n\n''Whether that's a better model, who knows.''\n\nStirling said allowing Graf to continue juggling her Opals and Capitals posts could also be the best option.\n\n''The thought process when I was coaching was coaches do need to be doing game-day coaching, that's an issue,'' she said. ''In my time frame [at the Opals] Brian Goorjian was head coach of the Boomers and also coached the Sydney Kings.\n\n''Whatever Goorjian got paid as the national coach I got paid, but he was probably on a six-figure sum [at the Kings] and I was certainly not on a six-figure sum at the Lightning.''\n\nThe Capitals are desperate for Basketball Australia to complete its review so they can press forward with their negotiations with Graf, which began this week.\n\nBasketball ACT boss Tony Jackson told The Canberra Times on Wednesday he wanted Basketball Australia to finalise its review before the end of the year.\n\nHowever, that might not eventuate with a statement released by a Basketball Australia representative yesterday indicating it is unlikely to be completed by Christmas.\n\n''Basketball Australia is currently undertaking a review of the four-year program leading into the 2012 Olympic Games, and key recommendations from that review are expected to form the basis for our strategic plan leading into Rio, 2016,'' the statement read.\n\n''The review will be finished in early 2013. It will incorporate announcements made last week by the Australian Sports Commission regarding the 'Winning Edge' strategy, and it will go to the Basketball Australia board for approval.''\n\nThe Capitals (5-6 win-loss record) hit the road to play Sydney (2-9) on Friday night keen to snap a three-game losing streak.\n\nGuard Michelle Cosier and forward Alex Bunton (virus) have not practised this week, and are expected to play fewer minutes.\n\nCosier's illness means Mikaela Dombkins is set to receive more court time against her former side.\n\nDombkins was superb in Canberra's 60-56 victory over Sydney on November 2, racking up 14 points.\n\n''Sydney's my old team and I always match up well against them,'' Dombkins said.

President Clinton visited Belfast three times, having become the first serving first US president to visit the region in 1995.\n\nPresident Clinton played a vital role in getting both sides to agree to ending violence in Northern Ireland, one of the biggest foreign policy triumphs of his administration.\n\nHe famously shook Gerry Adams's hand on the Falls Road in 1995, an event which now features in the official Belfast bus tour.

This visit will be one of her last foreign engagements as secretary of state before she steps down next month.\n\nSecretary Clinton has been busy across the globe since she took up the role in 2008, helping to secure the release of Chinese dissidents and putting pressure on India over trade with Iran.\n\nShe has set a record in her role as the best travelled secretary of state. In four years she has visited over 100 countries, taking in everywhere from Afghanistan to Zambia - and even new states such as Timor-Leste and South Sudan. In the process, according to official records, she has clocked up close to 1 million miles.\n\nDuring talks at an international summit in Dublin yesterday, Secretary Clinton continued to take a strong line on Syria, meeting with Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN envoy to Syria, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.\n\nShe warned that pressure against the regime in and around Damascus was increasing and raised fears over Syrian chemical weapons.\n\nMrs Clinton said: \"I think we will discuss that and many aspects of what needs to be done in order to end the violence and begin that transition.\"\n\nShe echoed President Barack Obama's warning that any action involving these weapons would cross a \"red line\" and provoke action, but did not specify what kind.\n\nIn the United States, many believe Secretary Clinton should become a presidential candidate in 2016. 57 per cent said they would back her candidacy in a recent poll by the Washington Post, while 82 per cent of Democrats are behind her.\n\nThe editor of the New Yorker magazine has predicted Hillary will run in 2016, and many believe she is stepping down from her current role to prepare for her next move.\n\nAt a recent conference on Israel, a video with endorsements from a number of international leaders including Tony Blair and Jordan's defence minister, Nasser Judeh, was played.\n\nThe video concluded with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu declaring: \"As someone who knows a thing or two about political comebacks, I can tell you I don't think we've heard the last of Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nHowever, she continues to deny that she plans to run for president in 2016.

Newspapers in Japan and South Korea have reported that Iranian observers were in the North for the launch, something Iran has denied.\n\nJapan's likely next prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who is leading in opinion polls ahead of an election on Sunday and who is known as a hawk on North Korea, called on the United Nations to adopt a resolution \"strongly criticising\" Pyongyang.\n\nA North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman reiterated that the rocket was a \"peaceful project\".\n\n\"The attempt to see our satellite launch as a long-range missile launch for military purposes comes from hostile perception that tries to designate us a cause for security tension,\" KCNA cited the spokesman as saying.\n\nChina had expressed \"deep concern\" prior to the launch which was announced a day after a top politburo member, representing new Chinese leader Xi Jinping, met Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang.\n\nOn Wednesday, its tone was measured, regretting the launch but calling for restraint on any counter-measures, in line with a policy of effectively vetoing tougher sanctions.\n\n\"China believes the Security Council's response should be cautious and moderate, protect the overall peaceful and stable situation on the Korean peninsula, and avoid an escalation,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei told journalists.\n\nBruce Klingner, a Korea expert at the Heritage Foundation, said: \"China has been the stumbling block to firmer U.N. action and we'll have to see if the new leadership is any different than its predecessors.\"\n\nA senior adviser to South Korea's president said last week it was unlikely there would be action from the United Nations and Seoul would expect its allies to tighten sanctions unilaterally.\n\nKim Jong-un, believed to be 29 years old, took power when his father died on Dec. 17 last year and experts believe the launch was intended to commemorate the first anniversary of his death. The April launch was timed for the centennial of the birth of Kim Il Sung.\n\nWednesday's success puts the North ahead of the South which has not managed to get a rocket off the ground.\n\n\"This is a considerable boost in establishing the rule of Kim Jong-un,\" said Cho Min, an expert at the Korea Institute of National Unification.\n\nThere have been few indications the secretive and impoverished state, where the United Nations estimates a third of people are malnourished, has made any advances in opening up economically over the past year.\n\nNorth Korea remains reliant on minerals exports to China and remittances from tens of thousands of its workers overseas.\n\nMany of its 22 million people need handouts from defectors, who have escaped to South Korea, for basic medicines.\n\nGiven the puny size of its economy - per capita income is less than $2,000 a year - one of the few ways the North can attract world attention is by emphasising its military threat.\n\nIt wants the United States to resume aid and to recognise it diplomatically, although the April launch scuppered a planned food deal.\n\nThe North is believed to be some years away from developing a functioning nuclear warhead although it may have enough plutonium for about half a dozen nuclear bombs, according to nuclear experts.\n\nIt has also been enriching uranium, which would give it a second path to nuclear weapons as it sits on big natural uranium reserves.\n\n\"A successful launch puts North Korea closer to the capability to deploy a weaponised missile,\" said Denny Roy, a senior fellow at the East-West Center in Hawaii.\n\n\"But this would still require fitting a weapon to the missile and ensuring a reasonable degree of accuracy. The North Koreans probably do not yet have a nuclear weapon small enough for a missile to carry.\"\n\nThe North says its work is part of a civil nuclear programme although it has also boasted of it being a \"nuclear weapons power\".", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:49:08.531-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:49:08.531-0400" } } ] },{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "54158ed52c243f028874cd09" }, "title" : "Dozens dead in Connecticut school shooting", "articles" : [ { "ext_url" : "http://www.foxcarolina.com/story/20346133/reports-27-dead-18-children-in-ct-elementary-school-shooting", "title" : "28 dead, including 20 children in school shooting in Newtown, CT", "text" : "View the history of school gun violence with this interactive database of campus shootings since 1997.\n\nView the history of school gun violence with this interactive database of campus shootings since 1997.\n\nResidents of Newtown, CT, are memorializing the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting.

(Source: WFSB)\n\nNEWTOWN, CT (RNN) - At least 28 people are dead, including 20 children, after a shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday, according to a Connecticut State Police spokesman. Law enforcement officials are working through the night to identify bodies and notify families, and a spokesman said they will release the names of the victims in a news conference at 8 a.m. ET Saturday.\n\nPolice officials told the Associated Press that the suspected gunman is 20-year-old Adam Lanza. His mother, Nancy Lanza, who was a teacher at the school, was found shot dead at the home she shared with Adam Lanza. He left her there and drove to the school in her car.\n\n\n\nAdam Lanza and six adults were among the dead at the scene. \n\n\n\nAn earlier report from law enforcement mistakenly mixed up the suspected shooter's name with his brother, 24-year-old Ryan Lanza. The brother was detained for questioning by police, according to the AP. Authorities do not believe he is an accomplice.\n\nRyan Lanza, who had not had contact with his younger brother since 2010, told law enforcement that Adam Lanza had a history of mental health problems.\n\n\n\nIt is the second deadliest school shooting in American history. The largest mass shooting at a school campus was at Virginia Tech University on April 26, 2007, when 32 people were killed and 17 more were injured. This is the second mass shooting this week after Jacob Roberts opened fire in a Portland, OR, mall, killing two and wounding one before committing suicide on Tuesday, Dec. 11.\n\nPresident Barack Obama made an emotional address to the nation, pausing to brush tears from his eyes and compose himself.\n\n\n\n\"Our hearts are broken today for the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children, and for the families of the adults who were lost,\" Obama said in a news conference. \"May God bless the memory of the victims. And in the words of scripture, heal the brokenhearted and bind up their wounds.\"\n\nHundreds of community members and family members mourned the loss of lives at a vigil that was given hours after the massacre.\n\nAccording to AP, the church was filled to capacity, hundreds spilled outside, some of them holding hands in circles and saying prayers. Others lit prayer candles and sang \"Silent Night.\"\n\nConnecticut State Police spokesman Lt. Paul Vance said at a Friday afternoon news conference that 18 children died at the scene of the shooting, and two more died after being transported to hospitals. Six adults and the gunman died at the scene, Vance said. Another adult victim who was transported to the hospital did survive.\n\nVance would not comment on the identity of the victim at the secondary location. He also said the identifying of victims will be a painstaking process, and that the families will be the first to be informed.\n\n\n\n\"We will leave no stone unturned as we look at every facet of this investigation - the shooter, victims - everything,\" Vance said.\n\nLaw enforcement officials said that the shooter killed himself with a self-inflicted gunshot.\n\n\n\nConnecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy also spoke at the news conference. He said the person responsible for the shooting was dead, \"as is an individual the perpetrator lived with.\" Vance said police secured a secondary crime scene where another adult was killed.\n\nA CNN reporter said police recovered three weapons at the scene: a Glock and a Sig-Sauer, which are handguns, as well as a .223 Bushmaster rifle. The rifle was in the back seat of the car the gunman drove to the school, the handguns were inside the school. The car belonged to Nancy Lanza.\n\n\n\nSecurity measures implemented this year at Sandy Hook kept doors locked during class hours, and people have to be buzzed in before entering. There is a camera to view whoever enters the building.\n\nAfter the shooting began, someone may have activated the loudspeaker system as a way of warning others in the school. A scream was heard over the speakers.\n\n\n\nA parent who was at the school told a CNN producer that the principal, vice principal and school psychologist left the office right after shots rang out. The vice principal, who had been shot in the foot or leg, crawled back into the office.\n\nThe parent said she saw the other two lying in the hall, along with children, \"in pools of blood,\" according to the producer.\n\n\n\nAuthorities said the suspected gunman's body was in a kindergarten classroom. At least some of the shooting took place inside that room.\n\nAccording to WFSB, authorities received word of the incident at the school around 9:41 a.m. ET.\n\nReporters on the scene observed a man in camouflage gear being taken away from the staging area. He screamed to people that he was not involved in the shooting.\n\nWhen police from state and local agencies arrived on scene, they began a search of the building, going room to room. Students and faculty were evacuated to the nearby Sandy Hook Volunteer Fire Department.\n\n\n\nSources told WFSB that Yale-New Haven Hospital activated an emergency triage unit, which responds to mass casualty incidents, in the school's parking lot.\n\nDanbury Hospital had at least three people admitted as a result of the incident, including a teacher who got shot in the foot, CNN stated. WFSB said officials at Bridgeport Hospital confirmed that they had admitted one woman who was shot, and she was in stable condition.\n\nThe school superintendent's office announced all campuses in the district had been locked down, and kindergarten classes at the school were canceled.\n\nPresident Barack Obama held a news conference at 3:15 p.m., saying he ordered for all flags across the country to fly at half-staff. In an emotion-filled statement, he said he felt the pain of the tragedy as a parent, not a president.\n\n\n\n\"We're going to have to take more action to prevent tragedies like this, regardless of the politics,\" Obama said.\n\nThe Newtown Public school system operates seven schools. There are four elementary schools, including Sandy Hook, that serve grades K to four, one intermediate school serving grades five to six, one middle school serving grades seven to eight and Newtown High School serving grades nine to 12.\n\nNewtown is a town of nearly 28,000 located in Fairfield County, CT, about 48 miles southwest of Hartford.

And each time I learn the news I react not as a President, but as anybody else would -- as a parent. And that was especially true today. I know there’s not a parent in America who doesn’t feel the same overwhelming grief that I do.\n\nThe majority of those who died today were children -- beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them -- birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers -- men and women who devoted their lives to helping our children fulfill their dreams.\n\nSo our hearts are broken today -- for the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children, and for the families of the adults who were lost. Our hearts are broken for the parents of the survivors as well, for as blessed as they are to have their children home tonight, they know that their children’s innocence has been torn away from them too early, and there are no words that will ease their pain.\n\nAs a country, we have been through this too many times. Whether it’s an elementary school in Newtown, or a shopping mall in Oregon, or a temple in Wisconsin, or a movie theater in Aurora, or a street corner in Chicago -- these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, and these children are our children. And we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics.\n\nThis evening, Michelle and I will do what I know every parent in America will do, which is hug our children a little tighter and we’ll tell them that we love them, and we’ll remind each other how deeply we love one another. But there are families in Connecticut who cannot do that tonight. And they need all of us right now. In the hard days to come, that community needs us to be at our best as Americans.

CBS 2 is reporting that teacher Natalie Hammond, 40, is in surgery and is expected to survive.\n\n“She was wonderful. The students had someone to go to if they needed someone, she was always there for them,” said Dianne Shay, herself a substitute teacher and Hochsprung’s neighbor. ” She was very genuine, very upbeat and outgoing.”\n\nShay said Hochsprung had two adult daughters.\n\nLanza used two handguns — a Glock and a Sig Sauer — and a .223-caliber assault rifle, an official said. An official also said Lanza’s girlfriend and another friend are missing in New Jersey.\n\nPolice in Hoboken questioned Lanza’s older brother, Ryan, 24, but an official told the AP he is not believed to have had any involvement in rampage.\n\nThe shooter was found with an ID that bore his brother’s name, a law-enforcement source said, but there is no indication that it was stolen. A source told The Post Ryan has told investigators he last saw Adam in 2010 and that Adam is autistic.\n\nRyan Lanza has a Facebook page that posted updates Friday afternoon that read that “it wasn’t me” and “I was at work.”\n\nAt least one parent said Lanza’s mother was a substitute teacher at the school. But her name did not appear on a staff list. And the law enforcement official said investigators were unable to establish any connection so far between her and the school.\n\nThe tragedy is among the nation’s deadliest school shootings, exceeded only by the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007, which left 32 people and the gunman dead.\n\nHeartwrenching dispatch calls reveal that Lanza’s rampage took only minutes.\n\nThe first word of the horrifying Newtown school shooting went out over the town’s police radio at 9:36 this morning.\n\nAt 9:46 a.m., as police searched the school, someone who could not hide the emotion in his voice radioed these haunting words: “I’ve got bodies here. Need ambulances.”\n\nRobert Licata said his 6-year-old son was in class when the gunman burst in and shot the teacher.\n\n“That’s when my son grabbed a bunch of his friends and ran out the door,” he said. “He was very brave. He waited for his friends.”\n\nHe said the shooter didn’t utter a word.\n\n“We were in my art teacher’s room. We heard some gunshots – like 20. Then the police came with guns and told us to close our eyes,” said fourth-grader Venesa Bajraliu, 9.\n\n“I heard gunshots and I saw policemen. My teacher was scared and a little shaky. We went into the office and police came and took us into the firehouse.”\n\nShe heard screams and gunshots over the intercom of the school, said her brother, Nergim, 17.\n\nNergim and his mother were the first to arrive at the school. He saw three young victims, who appeared wounded.\n\n“When I saw the girl come out with police, the girl was splattered with blood.”\n\nAn emotional President Obama addressed the nation this afternoon.\n\n“Our hearts are broken today for the parents, grandparents, sisters and brothers of these little children and for the families of the adults who were lost,” a teary-eyed Obama said.\n\nObama also expressed his grief for the parents of survivors, who in a scene of mass chaos, rushed to a nearby firehouse to pick up their children.\n\n“Our hearts are broken for the parents of the survivors as well, for as blessed as they are to have their children at home tonight, they know that their children’s innocence has been torn away from them too early. There are no words that will ease their pain.”\n\nMom Carrie Battaglia told The Post that the firehouse where she was told to pick up her children was in a state of chaos.\n\n“It’s a mob scene,” said Battaglia, 39, whose daughters, 6 and 8, attend the school. She said teachers were handing out water and crackers.\n\n“We’re just thankful our kids our OK, ” Battaglia said between tears. “I wouldn’t think anything like this would ever happen.”\n\nHer husband, David Battaglia, said, “It’s intense — people are trying to find their children.”\n\nJennifer Belward said her three- and four-year-old children were at the Children’s Adventure Center preschool next door to the elementary school.\n\n“They put them on lockdown and they were sitting in their cubbies eating pizza and watching a movie,” she said, as she walked hand-in-hand with them up Riverside Road.\n\nShe said her children were unaware of what happened.\n\nJoanne Didonato, the principal’s secretary, said she called in sick today – something she rarely does.\n\n“Of all days,” she said. “I want to go be with my colleagues. I’m sick over the news. I’ve been on the phone with some people but they don’t know. Everything is just up in the air right now, I know nothing.”\n\n“They’re saying children are killed. I just can’t handle that. We have great kids in our school and I’m just so upset over that.”\n\nAccording to a witness report, the school’s principal and another staffer were killed while another staffer was shot in the leg after a gunman opened fire in a hallway.\n\nA witness said gunshots were heard in the hallway during a meeting and that “100 rounds” must have been fired, according to CNN. After the shots were fired, three people ran into the hallway but only the vice principal crawled back.\n\nCops responded to reports of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary just after 9:40 a.m., and said the gunman was in the school’s main office, according to reports.\n\nThe newspaper reports that as of 11 a.m., police were still searching the school with dogs.\n\nParents told the Hartford Courant that some students were still in the school at 10:30 a.m. Groups of students, some crying and holding hands, were seen were being escorted away from the school by their teachers.\n\nOne child leaving the facility told the newspaper that there was shattered glass everywhere. A police officer ran into the classroom and told them to run outside and keep going until the reach the firehouse, according to the report.\n\nThree people from the scene were taken to Danbury Hospital, a hospital spokeswoman told NBC. The hospital is on lockdown.\n\n“There are no visitors allowed today. This hospital is on lockdown. Nobody is getting in or out,” one officer told The Post.\n\n“We grieve for all the people in our community afffected by today’s tragedy. We offer our heartfelt sympathy and prayers to all involved,” said Dr John Murphy president and CEO of Western Connecticut Health Network.\n\n“This is our home, this is where we live. We are here, we are open and no longer on lock down as we were earlier in the day. We are fully operational to provide any and all care and support for the people who need us today as well as those who will need us in the days to come.”\n\nMurphy said that the shooting was the most traumatic event he has “ever experienced or considered. It’s unthinkable and we’re all hurting here.”\n\nEarlier, Danbury Hospital posted a statement to their Facebook page: “We are here to care for any victims and their families in any way they need us. Our hearts and prayers are extended to anyone involved in this terrible tragedy. To date, three patients have been transported to Danbury Hospital from the scene. Out of abundance of caution and not because of any direct threat Danbury Hospital is under lockdown. This allows us simply to focus on the important work at hand. We will keep you apprised of any additional information as details are confirmed.”\n\nThe seven schools in the district were in lockdown mode, said Kathy June, of the Newtown Public School District.\n\nStephen Delgiadice said his 8-year-old daughter heard two big bangs and teachers told her to get in a corner. His daughter was fine.\n\n“It’s alarming, especially in Newtown, Connecticut, which we always thought was the safest place in America,” he said.\n\nBrenda Lebinski, whose 8-year-old daughter attends the school, was among the parents who raced to check on their children.\n\n“I saw her and it was the happiest moment of my life,” she said.\n\nConnecticut’s governor was on the scene in Newtown.\n\nAmbulances surrounded the school, about 60 miles northeast of of New York, and parents were running toward the building as a helicopter flew overhead.\n\nState police said Newtown police called them around 9:40 a.m. A SWAT team was among the throngs of police to respond.\n\nA photo posted by The Newtown Bee newspaper showed a group of young students — some crying, others looking visibly frightened — being escorted by adults through a parking lot in a line, hands on each other’s shoulders.\n\nCommunity members later gathered at a Newtown church, holding a vigil for the victims.\n\nPeople lit candles and held hands and sang, reflecting on the tragedy, numbed by the awful, twisted violence.\n\nAdditional reporting by Frank Rosario, Melanie Gray and Erin Calabrese.

I think tomorrow will probably be harder for her.\n\n“I also have a fifth-grader who came off the bus crying because she … had a sister who she was worried about, and … just basically left that school a few months ago.

It started as I put them to bed tonight, the questions.”\n\n[Updated at 10:50 p.m. ET] Janet Vollmer, a kindergarten teacher at the school, says she locked her classroom doors and – to keep her students calm – read them a story until the police came.\n\nVollmer, her 19 students and the adult helpers in her classroom were not injured.\n\n\"You could hear what sounded like pops, gunshots. Of course, I’m not going to tell that to 5-year-olds, so I said to them, ‘We’re going over in a safe area,'\" Vollmer told CNN's Anderson Cooper. \"And we read a story and we kept them calm, did a lockdown drill, closed the doors, locked (them), covered the windows, and kept the children with us.”\n\nShe said the children knew something unusual was going on.\n\n“It didn’t seem a natural thing (to the children), although we do practice drills,\" Vollmer said. \"We said, ‘We’re not really sure, but we’re going to be safe, because we’re sitting over here and we’re all together.’”\n\nWhen asked how she kept cool, she said: “With 5-year-olds, you can’t lose it. I’ve been doing this for a long time, it’s my 18th year of teaching. My job was to keep them safe.\"\n\n\"After we got down to the firehouse, later on, as a lot of the events started to unfold throughout the day I think some of (the children) realized the magnitude of what was going on.,\" she said. \"They saw other people upset. We just held them close until their parents came and we released them.”\n\n[Updated at 8:58 p.m. ET] Denise Correia says her daughter, a Sandy Hook Elementary second-grader who was not injured, heard the gunshots from the classroom she was in. The girl, while talking about the shooting with Correia, has been mentioning slain principal Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung \"quite a lot.\"\n\n\"I think everyone's coping as best as they possibly can,\" Correia told CNN's Anderson Cooper. \"I'm letting her talk. She's mentioned quite a bit about the principal, who many of us have worked with. I adored her. I worked with her personally with my business. That is one person I know we have lost on a personal level.\"\n\nCorreia said she has heard that her daughter's teacher, when the gunfire started, grabbed two kids from the hallway, put them into her classroom with other students, locked the door and gathered the students to a side of the room away from the gunfire. \"She did a very heroic thing,\" Correia said of the teacher.\n\n\"The kids are going to suffer from this,\" Correia said. \"...

The Bushmaster was found in a car outside the school. The official did not know if the car was registered to the gunman, to his mother or to someone else.\n\nThe official echoed what other law enforcement officials have told CNN: That Adam Lanza was the suspected gunman, and that he died at the scene of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot.\n\n[Updated at 6:44 p.m. ET] Three U.S. law enforcement officials, from different agencies, separately tonight identified the suspected shooter as Adam Lanza, contrary to what investigators had said previously. It is not clear what caused the confusion among investigators.\n\nHis older brother, Ryan, was taken into custody for general questioning from a home in Hoboken, New Jersey. Officials did not label Ryan Lanza as a suspect. It is unclear when he may be released.\n\nOne of the officials say Adam’s father was also taken in for similar questioning. There is no indication that the father will be charged. The official noted the father has remarried and lives with his new wife in a residence in the general area of Connecticut not too far from where his ex-wife lived.\n\n[Updated at 6:43 p.m. ET] CNN’s Susan Candiotti is talking to investigators at the scene as they piece together exactly what happened and when. She says she’s learned that the mother of the suspected shooter, Nancy Lanza, was found dead in the suspect’s home in Newtown.\n\n“Earlier we had information that she was found in the classroom. However, now I’m being told that in fact her body was found at the suspect's residence,\" Candiotti said. \"We don't know whether she also lived there. We also don't know the timeline – when was she killed? Was she killed before the shooting began at the school? These are the things that authorities are still trying to piece together.”\n\n[Updated at 6:02 p.m. ET] \"Evil visited this community today,\" Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy just told reporters in Newtown. \"And it's too early to speak of recovery, but each parent, each sibling, each member of the family has to understand that Connecticut - we're all in this together.\n\n\"We'll do whatever we can to overcome this event. We will get through it. But this is a terrible time for this community and these families.\"\n\n[Updated at 5:14 p.m. ET] The mother of the suspected shooter was found dead in her son's residence in Newtown, a law enforcement source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN. CNN had previously identified the mother as Nancy Lanza, a teacher at the Sandy Hook Elementary, according to law enforcement sources.\n\nThe source also told CNN there was no body found in the house searched by authorities in Hoboken, New Jersey. Two law enforcement sources say a man was taken away from questioning from that house. He is believed to be the brother of the shooter, according to the sources.\n\nThe first law enforcement source says the school shooter was dressed in \"black battle fatigues and a military vest.\"\n\nThe Bushmaster .223 found at the scene is a semi automatic weapon, the source says. Two other weapons found were handguns, a Sig-Sauer and a Glock.\n\n[Updated at 5:10 p.m. ET] We just learned that Governor Dannel P. Malloy will be speaking at Treadwell Park in Newtown, Connecticut, at 6:00 p.m. ET.\n\n[Updated at 5:04 p.m. ET] We've just received a statement from U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan about the shooting:\n\n\"Our hearts and prayers go out to every parent, child, teacher, staff member, and administrator at Sandy Hook and the surrounding community. And our thanks go out to every teacher, staff member, and first responder who cared for, comforted, and protected children from harm, often at risk to themselves. We will do everything in our power to assist and support the healing and recovery of Newtown.\"\n\n\"School shootings are always incomprehensible and horrific tragedies. But words fail to describe today's heartbreaking and savage attack at Sandy Hook Elementary School. As the father of two children in elementary school, I can barely imagine the anguish and losses suffered today by the Newtown community.\n\n[Updated at 5:01 p.m. ET] Law enforcement officials are not prepared to identify the shooter right now, Connecticut State PoliceLt. J. Paul Vance said in a press conference.\n\nVance said that they are working diligently at the crime scene as well as with the medical examiner to identify the victims.\n\n\"We will leave no stone unturned,\" Vance added about the entire investigation.\n\n[Updated at 4:54 p.m. ET] We are now being told there was no body found in the Hoboken, New Jersey, home as had been previously reported.\n\n[Updated at 4:23 p.m. ET] We have learned that Connecticut police have searched the suspected gunman's home and place of employment in the wake of Friday's mass shooting, Connecticut State Police Lt. Paul Vance told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.\n\nThey have also interviewed his friends, relatives and \"everyone who possibly had any connection with him whatsoever,\" he said.\n\n[Updated at 4:11 p.m. ET] Police did not discharge their weapons at any time when responding at the school, police spokesman Lt. Paul Vance told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. However, he could not confirm whether the suspected shooter - who died at the scene - killed himself, saying that would have to be determined by the medical examiner.\n\n[Updated at 4:07 p.m. ET] Mark Kelly, who's lived through this kind of horror, has issued a statement. He's the husband of former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords who was shot in the head at a massacre in Tucson, Arizona, in January 2011. Here's what he said:\n\nI just woke up in my hotel room in Beijing, China, to learn that another mass shooting has taken place - this time at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims and the entire community of Newtown, CT. I just spoke to Gabby, and she sends her prayers from Tucson.\n\nAs we mourn, we must sound a call for our leaders to stand up and do what is right. This time our response must consist of more than regret, sorrow, and condolence. The children of Sandy Hook Elementary School and all victims of gun violence deserve leaders who have the courage to participate in a meaningful discussion about our gun laws - and how they can be reformed and better enforced to prevent gun violence and death in America.

Witnesses and officials described a horrific scene as the gunman, with brutal efficiency, chose his victims in two classrooms while other students dove under desks and hid in closets.\n\nHundreds of terrified parents arrived as their sobbing children were led out of the Sandy Hook Elementary School in a wooded corner of Newtown, Conn. By then, all of the victims had been shot and most were dead, and the gunman, identified as Adam Lanza, had committed suicide. The children killed were said to be 5 to 10 years old.\n\nA 28th person, found dead in a house in the town, was also believed to have been shot by Mr. Lanza. That victim, one law enforcement official said, was Mr. Lanza’s mother, Nancy Lanza, who was initially reported to be a teach at the school. She apparently owned the guns he used.\n\nAlthough reports at the time indicated that the principal of the school let Mr. Lanza in because she recognized him, his mother did not work at the school, and he shot his way in, defeating a security system requiring visitors to be buzzed in. Moments later, the principal was shot dead when she went to investigate the sound of gunshots. The school psychologist was also among those who died.\n\nThe rampage, coming less than two weeks before Christmas, was the nation’s second-deadliest school shooting, exceeded only by the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, in which a gunman killed 32 people and then himself.\n\nLaw enforcement officials said Mr. Lanza had grown up in Newtown, and he was remembered by high school classmates as smart, introverted and nervous. They said he had gone out of his way not to attract attention when he was younger.\n\nThe gunman was chillingly accurate. A spokesman for the State Police said he left only one wounded survivor at the school. All the others hit by the barrage of bullets from the guns Mr. Lanza carried died, suggesting that they were shot at point-blank range. One law enforcement official said the shootings occurred in two classrooms in a section of the single-story Sandy Hook Elementary School.\n\nSome who were there said the shooting occurred during morning announcements, and the initial shots could be heard over the school’s public address system. The bodies of those killed were still in the school as of 10 p.m. Friday.\n\nThe New York City medical examiner’s office sent a “portable morgue” to Newtown to help with the aftermath of the shootings, a spokeswoman, Ellen Borakove, confirmed late Friday.\n\nLaw enforcement officials offered no hint of what had motivated Mr. Lanza. It was also unclear, one investigator said, why Mr. Lanza — after shooting his mother to death inside her home — drove her car to the school and slaughtered the children. “I don’t think anyone knows the answers to those questions at this point,” the official said. As for a possible motive, he added, “we don’t know much for sure.”\n\nF.B.I. agents interviewed his brother, Ryan Lanza, in Hoboken, N.J. His father, Peter Lanza, who was divorced from Nancy Lanza, was also questioned, one official said.\n\nNewtown, a postcard-perfect New England town where everyone seems to know everyone else and where there had lately been holiday tree lightings with apple cider and hot chocolate, was plunged into mourning. Stunned residents attended four memorial services in the town on Friday evening as detectives continued the search for clues, and an explanation.\n\nMaureen Kerins, a hospital nurse who lives close to the school, learned of the shooting from television and hurried to the school to see if she could help.\n\n“I stood outside waiting to go in, but a police officer came out and said they didn’t need any nurses,” she said, “so I knew it wasn’t good.”\n\nIn the cold light of Friday morning, faces told the story outside the stricken school. There were the frightened faces of children who were crying as they were led out in a line. There were the grim faces of women. There were the relieved-looking faces of a couple and their little girl.\n\nThis article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A correction posted with an earlier version of this article was published in error. As the initial article correctly noted, the gunman in the Connecticut shooting used a rifle to carry out the shootings inside the Sandy Hook Elementary School; he did not use two handguns. (He did use a handgun to kill himself.) This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., that left 20 children and 8 adults dead, using information from the authorities, misstated the way in which the gunman managed to enter the Sandy Hook Elementary School. The gunman, Adam Lanza, shot his way in, defeating the security system that required visitors to be buzzed in; the school’s principal did not allow him to go through the security system after recognizing him. The article also referred incorrectly to the gunman’s mother, Nancy, whom he killed in the house they shared not far from the school.

Superior Court (People) (1988) 198 Cal. App. 3d 1101 [244 Cal. Rptr. 328]", "text" : "HENRY STEVEN LEWIS, Petitioner, v. THE SUPERIOR COURT OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY, Respondent; THE PEOPLE, Real Party in Interest\n\nNo appearance for Real Party in Interest. [198 Cal. App. 3d 1103]\n\nOn September 2, 1987, counsel for petitioner, who is charged with felony offenses, filed a declaration seeking to disqualify Judge John H. Major on the ground of bias or prejudice against petitioner or his counsel. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 170.1, 170.3, subd. (c)(1).) fn. 1 On October 9, 1987, no action having been taken by Judge Major on the statement of disqualification, the parties appeared for a hearing on a pretrial motion filed by petitioner. At the outset of the proceedings Judge Major ordered the statement of disqualification stricken on the ground it disclosed no legal grounds for disqualification. (§ 170.4, subd. (b).) [1] In the instant proceeding, petitioner contends Judge Major is deemed to have consented to his disqualification by failing to file an answer within 10 days after the filing of the statement, hence he may not further participate in the proceeding. For reasons that follow, we find petitioner's contention meritorious and will direct that further proceedings be heard before a trial judge other than Judge Major.\n\nSubdivision (c) of section 170.3 provides in relevant part as follows: \"(3) Within 10 days after the filing or service [of a statement of disqualification], whichever is later, the judge may file a consent to disqualification ... or ... a written verified answer admitting or denying any or all of the allegations contained in the party's statement and setting forth any additional facts material or relevant to the question of disqualification. ...\n\n\"(4) A judge who fails to file a consent or answer within the time allowed shall be deemed to have consented to his or her disqualification and the clerk shall notify the presiding judge or person authorized to appoint a replacement of the recusal. ...\n\n\"(5) No judge who refuses to recuse himself or herself shall pass upon his or her own disqualification or upon the sufficiency in law, fact, or otherwise, of the statement of disqualification filed by a party. In every such case, the question of disqualification shall be heard and determined by another judge. ...\" (Italics added.)\n\nIt thus becomes clear that, having failed to file an answer to the statement of disqualification, as of October 9 Judge Major was deemed to have consented to his disqualification and the clerk had the duty to notify the presiding [198 Cal. App. 3d 1104] judge to appoint a replacement of the recusal. (§ 170.3, subd. (c)(4).) The respondent urges however that despite the clear language of section 170.3, subdivision (c)(4), Judge Major had the power on October 9 to strike petitioner's statement for insufficiency. In support of this contention the respondent cites subdivision (b) of section 170.4, which provides: \"Notwithstanding paragraph (5) of subdivision (c) of Section 170.3, if a statement of disqualification is untimely filed or if on its face it discloses no legal grounds for disqualification, the trial judge against whom it was filed may order it stricken.\"\n\nWe do not construe the foregoing provision as providing an exception to the automatic disqualification of a judge who fails to file an answer within 10 days as required by paragraphs (3) and (4) of section 170.3, subdivision (c). By its own terms, the provision provides an exception only to paragraph (5) of subdivision (c), which precludes a challenged judge from passing upon \"his or her own disqualification or upon the sufficiency in law, fact, or otherwise, of the statement of disqualification filed by a party.\"\n\nWe therefore hold that although a challenged judge has the power to order a statement of disqualification stricken as legally insufficient, such power must be exercised within the time limits imposed by section 170.3, subdivision (c)(3). Having failed to do so, Judge Major was disqualified and has no power to act in this case.\n\n[2] The issue presented in this proceeding is one of law, and we see no purpose to be served by issuing an alternative writ. The parties have received due notice from this court that the issuance of a peremptory writ in the first instance is being considered, and under such circumstances the issuance of a peremptory writ in the first instance is proper. (§ 1088; Palma v. U.S. Industrial Fasteners, Inc. (1984) 36 Cal. 3d 171, 178-179 [203 Cal.Rptr. 626, 681 P.2d 893].)\n\nLet a writ of mandate issue directing the respondent Los Angeles County Superior Court to appoint a replacement of Judge John H. Major in case number A708196. (See § 170.3, subd. (c)(4).) [198 Cal. App. 3d 1105]\n\nGood reason appearing, this decision shall be deemed final as to this court five (5) days from the date hereof. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 24(c).) The stay of proceedings heretofore imposed shall be dissolved upon the finality of this decision.\n\nFN 1.

Litigants filed appeals in 11 percent of all tort trials, 21 percent of trials involving contracts and 24 percent of property trials. The appellate stage of civil litigation is particularly important because such courts have the authority to reverse or modify a trial court's findings. Looking at the appeals process provides a better sense of the true cost of litigation, the likelihood of receiving an award and the time required to finalize a civil suit. The BJS report, Appeals From General Civil Trials in 46 Large Counties, 2001 - 2005, examined 1,204 state court civil trials in 46 populous counties concluded during 2001 that were subsequently appealed to an intermediate appellate court or a court of last resort. The report examines the percentage of cases appealed, the types of parties who filed an appeal and the rates that verdicts were affirmed or reversed from 2001 through April 2005. The report indicates the higher the stakes, the greater the likelihood the outcome will be appealed. For example, approximately one-third of products liability and 18 percent of medical malpractice trials were appealed. On the other hand, in automobile accident trials, which typically result in small dollar awards, only five percent were appealed. Overall, plaintiffs and defendants filed appeals at nearly equal rates. Of the cases appealed, 43 percent were dismissed or withdrawn prior to disposition and 57 percent were reviewed on appeal and decided on the merits by an intermediate appellate court or court of last resort. Among civil appeals decided on the merits, the trial court verdict was affirmed in two-thirds of the cases and reversed or modified in one-third of the cases. Trial court verdicts or judgments that found for plaintiffs were reversed or modified on appeal more often than trial court outcomes favoring defendants (42 percent vs. 21 percent). Most reversed or modified appeals were sent back to the trial court for a new trial or with additional instructions to modify the award. According to the report, the appeals process provides another opportunity for litigants in a sizeable percentage of cases to reach a settlement outside the court. Many appeals are withdrawn or dismissed because the parties reach settlement after the initial appeal is filed. Two hundred eighteen cases that had been appealed to an intermediate appellate court were subsequently appealed to a court of last resort. Twenty-five of these cases were granted additional review by a court of last resort. The report, \"Appeals From General Civil Trials in 46 Large Counties, 2001-2005\" (NCJ-212979) was written by BJS statistician Thomas H. Cohen.

The data included names, street addresses, phone numbers and email addresses, according to CNET.\n\nThe move was announced on @YourAnonNews, the collective's main mouthpiece on Twitter.\n\nPhelps-Roper's Twitter was also hacked and the Westboro Baptist Church's website was taken down. Anonymous claimed responsibility for both via the @YourAnonNews account.\n\n@YourAnonNews is also asking followers to sign a petition against Westboro's tax-exempt status. Because of its status as a religious entity, the Westboro Baptist Church is able to avoid paying taxes.\n\nA post on the White House's \"We the People\" online petition forum explains the petition:\n\n\"The Westboro Baptist Church is better-known for homophobic displays, suing people and picketing funerals than for providing Christian care to a community. Due to their harassment and politicking, their IRS tax-exempt status should be immediately investigated.\"\n\nAnother petition wants Westboro to be recognized not as a religious group, but as a hate group.\n\nAnonymous was not the only group that fought back against Westboro over the weekend. Reddit users announced plans to travel to Newtown to create “a silent blockade during the funeral processions\" to hinder any possible Westboro Baptist Church protests, according to a CT News blog post.\n\nThe Kansas-based Westboro Baptist Church is best known for picketing the funerals of U.S. soldiers and AIDS victims, because of its anti-gay stance.

State Police said. An additional weapon, a shotgun, was found in Lanza's vehicle outside the school.\n\nSunday was also the first official confirmation that Lanza was the shooter who killed six adults and twenty children inside the school.\n\nAccording to Connecticut State Police Lt. Paul Vance, Lanza had multiple high-capacity magazines for the Bushmaster AR-15 rifle. Those high-capacity magazines held 30 rounds each, Vance said.\n\nLanza also had multiple magazines for the Glock 10mm and Sig Sauer 9mm handguns.\n\nAs a result, Vance said, Lanza was armed with \"hundreds of bullets.\"\n\nSaturday, Connecticut medical examiner Dr. H. Wayne Carver said the 7 victims he examined had each been shot between three and eleven times. He also said he believed each victim was shot multiple times.\n\nIf the three-to-eleven shot estimate is accurate for each victim, and Lanza used only 30-round magazines, he would have used between four and ten magazines.\n\nState Police refused to comment on precisely how many magazines were emptied or shell casings were found, but said they had collected those items for examination.\n\nStill, the shooting ended while Lanza still had enough unused ammunition to carry out significant additional carnage.\n\n\"There was a lot of ammo, a lot of clips,\" State Police Lt. Paul Vance. \"Certainly a lot of lives were potentially saved.\"\n\nVance said Lanza used one of the handguns to take his own life, but wouldn't speculate on when or why Lanza decided to end his spree.\n\nEarly in the Sunday afternoon statement, Vance also confirmed that the shooter's mother, Nancy Lanza, was the victim found at an alternate location. She was shot four times in the head and found in her bed wearing pajamas, said a state official who was not authorized to disclose details of the investigation and spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n\nEducation officials said they had found no link between Lanza's mother and the school, contrary to news reports that said she was a teacher there. Investigators said they believe Adam Lanza attended Sandy Hook many years ago, but they had no explanation for why he went there Friday.\n\nAs President Barack Obama prepared a visit and churches opened their doors to comfort a grieving town Sunday, federal agents fanned out to dozens of gun stores and shooting ranges across Connecticut, chasing leads they hoped would cast light on Lanza's life.\n\nAmong the questions: Why did his mother, a well-to-do suburban divorcee , keep a cache of high-power weapons in the house? What experience did Lanza have with those guns? And, above all, what set him on a path to go classroom-by-classroom, massacring 6- and 7-year-olds?\n\nAt St. Rose of Lima Roman Catholic church in Newtown, Jennifer Waters, who at 6 is the same age as many of the victims and attends a different school, came to Mass on Sunday in Newtown with a lot of questions.\n\n\"The little children — are they with the angels?\" she asked her mother while fiddling with a small plastic figurine on a pew near the back of the church. \"Are they going to live with the angels?\"\n\nHer mother, Joan, 45, assured her they were, then put a finger to her daughter's lips, urging her to be quiet.\n\nAn overflow crowd of more than 800 people attended the 9 a.m. service at the church, where eight children will be buried later this week. The gunman, Adam Lanza, and his mother also attended church here. Spokesman Brian Wallace said the diocese has yet to be asked to provide funerals for either.\n\nBoxes of tissues were placed strategically in each pew and on each window sill. The altar was adorned with bouquets, one shaped as a broken heart, with a zigzag of red carnations cutting through the white ones.\n\nIn his homily, the Rev. Jerald Doyle, the diocesan administrator, tried to answer the question of how parishioners could find joy in the holiday season with so much sorrow surrounding them.\n\n\"You won't remember what I say, and it will become unimportant,\" he said. \"But you will really hear deep down that word that will finally and ultimately bring peace and joy.

You are self-appointed servants of God who rewrite the words of His sacred scripture to adhere to your prejudice. Your hatred supersedes your faith, and you use faith to promote your hatred.\n\n\n\nSince your one-dimensional thought protocol will conform not to any modern logic, we will not debate, argue, or attempt to reason with you. Instead, we have unanimously deemed your organization to be harmful to the population of The United States of America, and have therefore decided to execute an agenda of action which will progressively dismantle your institution of deceitful pretext and extreme bias, and cease when your zealotry runs dry. We recognize you as serious opponents, and do not expect our campaign to terminate in a short period of time. Attrition is our weapon, and we will waste no time, money, effort, and enjoyment, in tearing your resolve into pieces, as with exposing the incongruity of your distorted faith.\n\n\n\nAnonymous possesses a plethora of information within our network about the many divisions of Christianity and numerous other religious doctrines. Many of us are versed in the biblical text, and we can identify each and every of your violations of scripture. You abuse the Holy Bible which you do not fully comprehend and know not of the thousands of authors to impose upon other people when you can simply coalesce with your loved ones and live in the manner you deem plausible. You engage in reciprocal fornication with another man and preach adultery as a sin. You, Shirley Lynn Phelps-Roper violated Deuteronomy 5:18. As a result, your son Sam is the living, breathing proof of your act of simple loneliness. Simply put, it takes not a genius to realize an arrogant woman's loose moral string, and its predilection to progressively wither and fray.\n\n\n\nFrom the time you have received this message, our attack protocol has past been executed and your downfall is underway.

Former classmates remembered him as a brainy and quiet teen who sometimes wore a pocket protector.\n\nTim Arnone told Reuters that he first met Lanza at Sandy Hook and attended Newtown High School with him, where the two were members of a technology club. He said Lanza was \"driven hard\" to succeed academically by his parents, particularly his mother.\n\nNancy Lanza and her husband, Peter Lanza, divorced in 2008, according to public records. Peter Lanza could not immediately be reached for comment but has spoken to police.\n\nJoshua Milas, who graduated from Newtown High School in 2009, told The Associated Press that Adam Lanza was generally a happy person but that he hadn't seen him in a few years.\n\n\"We would hang out, and he was a good kid. He was smart,\" Joshua Milas said. \"He was probably one of the smartest kids I know.\"\n\nCatherine Urso, of Newtown, told the Associated Press her college-age son knew Lanza. \"He just said he was very thin, very remote and was one of the Goths,\" she said.\n\nLaw enforcement officials initially told NBC News that the gunman was Lanza's brother, Ryan, and they had sent out a bulletin to local and federal law enforcement agencies to that effect.\n\nBut when authorities went to Ryan's home in Hoboken, N.J., to search it, they unexpectedly found him there.\n\nRyan told police he was not involved and that his brother has a history of mental health issues and might have had his ID even though they had not seen each other in two years, officials said.\n\nA senior official later said that Ryan was nowhere near the shooting, was not believed to be involved, and was cooperating with the investigation.\n\nLanza's aunt, Marsha Lanza, of Crystal Lake, Ill., told the AP she was close with Adam Lanza's mother and sent her a Facebook message Friday morning asking how she was doing. Nancy Lanza never responded.\n\nMarsha Lanza described Nancy Lanza as a good mother and kind-hearted. She said her husband saw Adam Lanza as recently as June and recalled nothing out of the ordinary about him.\n\nNancy Lanza’s mother was too distraught to speak when reached by phone at her home in Brooksville, Fla., the AP reported.\n\n\"I just don't know, and I can't make a comment right now,\" Dorothy Hanson, 78, said in a shaky voice as she started to cry.\n\nFollow US news from NBCNews.com on Twitter and Facebook", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:49:54.922-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:49:54.922-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/anonymous-seizes-westboro-baptists-domain-during-live-tv-confrontation/", "title" : "Anonymous seizes Westboro Baptist's domain during live TV confrontation", "text" : "During a live TV interview between an Anonymous member and Shirley Phelps-Roper from the Westboro Baptist Church, the escalating war between the two has peaked. In the 10-minute-plus interview, Phelps-Roper repeatedly blamed Anonymous for a letter released earlier this week promising to attack the infamous Westboro Baptist Church. Anonymous has been claiming since the accusation that it was not the author of the widely circulated message, and insists the entire operation was likely a ploy for attention on the congregation’s part.\n\nDuring the interview, Anonymous continuously and calmly reiterated it was not responsible for the original letter, and that the church’s site had been taken down earlier by another hacktivist widely known as “th3j3st3r.” The Jester took credit for the hack via his Twitter on February 21.\n\nBut Phelps-Roper would have none of it. Between hurling insults and thanking Anonymous for the increased attention to the church’s cause (which includes degrading fallen US soldiers and homosexuals), she refused to hear out Anonymous’ defense. After nearly nine minutes of listening to her crazed diatribe, the hacktivist group took action. “I was just going to say in the time that Shirley was blabbing her religious preachings I actually did some business and I think if you check downloads.westborobaptistchurch right now you’ll see a nice message from Anonymous.”\n\nIndeed, after insisting that no hacker could take down its controversial website, Anonymous was able to do so in a matter of moments, and seemingly without prior planning. “We just put up a nice release while Shirley was preaching there…Yeah we just, we had enough. We responded [to the original letter from Westboro Baptist] maturely…then Shirley comes on the show, [says] I’m going to hell, so we’ve given her something to look at.”\n\nPhelps-Roper, somewhere between resilient and irate, seems to misinterpret the episode and asks, “So are you saying you did take down the websites or you did not take down the websites?”\n\nThe domain is currently inaccessible, but you can view a cached page here. It begins, “Greetings Westboro Baptist Church, if you’re reading this, it means that Anonymous has lost its patience with you, likely because you’ve threatened us again after we denied you a war.” The group also points out the organization is far and away below its standards, and that operations involving Middle Eastern countries in revolution and the HBGary controversy are more deserving of its time and effort. In addition to the message, Anonymous also included access to Westboro Baptist’s internal server.\n\nAnonymous has established itself as a force not to be tampered with, and gained notoriety along the way. Various organizations may be willing to attach themselves to its name for publicity, or even to belittle its cause – which Westboro Baptist has obviously learned the hard way. “The world (including Anonymous) disagrees with your hateful messages, but you have the right to voice them. This does not mean you can jump onto Anonymous for attention. God hates fags: assumption. Anonymous hates leeches: fact,” concludes the letter.\n\nCheck out the video in full below.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:49:56.451-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:49:56.451-0400" } } ] },{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "54158f002c243f028874cd0d" }, "title" : "Journalists escape after being kidnapped in Syria", "articles" : [ { "ext_url" : "http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/12/18/15985279-richard-engel-and-nbc-news-team-freed-from-captors-in-syria", "title" : "Richard Engel and NBC News team freed from captors in Syria", "text" : "Updated at 8:15 a.m. ET: NBC News’ Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel and members of his network production team were freed from captors in Syria after a firefight at a checkpoint on Monday, five days after they were taken prisoner, NBC News said early Tuesday.\n\n“After being kidnapped and held for five days inside Syria by an unknown group, NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel and his production crew members have been freed unharmed. We are pleased to report they are safely out of the country,” the network said in a statement.\n\n“It is good to be here,” Engel said during a live appearance on TODAY from Turkey. “I’m very happy that we’re able to do this live shot this morning.”\n\nEngel said that they were traveling with Syrian rebels when a group of about 15 gunmen “jumped out of the trees and bushes” and captured them.\n\n'Psychological torture'\n\nHe said the gunmen executed one of the rebels “on the spot,” and later during their captivity they were subjected to mock executions while blindfolded and bound.\n\n\"We weren't physically beaten or tortured. It was a lot of psychological torture, threats of being killed,\" Engel said.\n\n\"They made us choose which one of us would be shot first and when we refused there were mock shootings. They pretended to shoot Ghazi [Balkiz, an NBC producer] several times,” Engel said.\n\nBalkiz said that they had “worked with each other very well… we kept each other’s spirits up” during their ordeal. Cameraman John Kooistra said he had “made good with my maker” and had been “prepared to die many times.”\n\nEngel said their captors “were talking openly about their loyalty to the government” of Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\nHe said he had a “very good idea” about who they were -- members of the “shabiha” militia, loyal to Assad, trained by the Iran’s Revolutionary Guard and allied with Lebanon-based group Hezbollah.\n\nEngel said their captors’ plan was to use them to win the freedom of people held by the rebels.\n\n“They captured us in order to carry out this exchange,” he said.\n\nEngel, 39, and his team disappeared shortly after crossing into northwest Syria from Turkey on Thursday. The network had not been able to contact them until learning that they had been freed on Monday.\n\nThe network said there was no claim of responsibility, no contact with the captors and no request for ransom during the time the crew was missing.\n\nAfter entering Syria, Engel and his team were abducted, tossed into the back of a truck before being transported to an unknown location believed to be near the small town of Ma’arrat Misrin. During their captivity, they were blindfolded and bound, but otherwise not physically harmed, the network said.\n\nEarly Monday evening local time, the prisoners were being moved to a new location in a vehicle when their captors ran into a checkpoint manned by members of the Ahrar al-Sham brigade, a Syrian rebel group. There was a confrontation and a firefight ensued. Two of the captors were killed, while an unknown number of others escaped, the network said.\n\nThe NBC News crew was unharmed in the incident. They remained in Syria until Tuesday morning when they made their way to the border and re-entered Turkey, the network said. They were to be evaluated and debriefed, but had communicated that everyone was in good health.\n\nNBC News said it “expressed its gratitude to those who worked to gather information and secure the release of our colleagues.”\n\nEngel is widely regarded as one of America’s leading foreign correspondents for his coverage of wars, revolutions and political transitions around the world over the last 15 years. Most recently, he was recognized for his outstanding reporting on the 2011 revolution in Egypt, the conflict in Libya and unrest throughout the Arab world.\n\nOne of the only Western journalists to cover the entire war in Iraq , Engel was named chief foreign correspondent of NBC News in April 2008. He joined the network in May 2003.\n\nThe Syrian civil war began in March 2011, when demonstrators took to the streets to show support for the so-called Arab Spring uprisings sweeping across the Middle East and north Africa and to demand the resignation of Assad of the ruling Ba’ath Party. The following month, Assad deployed the Syrian army to quell the uprising, ordering troops to open fire on demonstrators. But despite the harsh crackdown, Assad’s troops and militias loyal to the government were unable to quell what soon became an armed uprising.\n\nIn the intervening months, the security situation in the country has continued to deteriorate amid increasingly fierce fighting between Syrian troops and a loose confederation of outgunned but increasingly emboldened rebel forces. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimated in November that more than 40,000 people had died in the fighting.\n\nFollow World News from NBCNews.com on Twitter and Facebook", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:50:00.235-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:50:00.235-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=2281189&language=en", "title" : "KUNA : Turkish reporter missing inside Syria since past five days", "text" : "ANKARA, Dec 17 (KUNA) -- Turkish reporter working for US news channel (NBC), Aziz Akyava has been missing since the past five days, amid reports that the Syrian regime might have kidnapped him.\n\n According to Turkish news channel (NTV) the reporter went missing since last Wednesday.

Engel and Aziz Akyavaş, a Turkish journalist who was working with him, have been unaccounted for in the Asian country since December 13. Turkish media has been circulating the \"missing persons\" report for several days, but up until Monday (Dec. 14) American news outlets had been operating under a \"news blackout\" requested by NBC. Gawker was the first social media gossip site in the U.S. to report on Engel's being missing.\n\n\n\nLike Us on Facebook\n\nAccording to reports, Engel's last report was on Dec. 11 and his last tweet was on Dec. 6, which is worrisome since Engel is an avid tweeter.\n\n\n\nUpon hearing the news in the States, Engel's NBC colleague David Shuster tweeted his concern about the missing journalist and author:\n\n\n\n@DavidShuster: \"Original report from Turkish media... Praying its wrong. RT@sallykohn: My thoughts are with NBC's Richard Engel, missing in Syria.\"\n\n\n\nGawker decided to break NBC's news blackout because, according to blogger John Cook, \" I would not have written a post if someone had told me that there was a reasonable or even remote suspicion that anything specific [like the men's death] would happen if I wrote the post.\"\n\n\n\nEngel, who is not married and has no children, is one of the only western journalists to cover the entire war in Iraq. He joined NBC News in May 2003 and became the station's chief foreign correspondent in 2008. As the correspondent in charge of NBC's Middle East bureau, Engel has been reporting on the ongoing conflict between rebels and supporters of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Engel is widely recognized for his coverage of wars, revolutions, and political transitions around the world over the past 15 years. Engel's work and dedication has been recognized with numerous awards and honors, including the Medill Medal for Courage in Journalism for his report \"War Zone Diary,\" five News & Documentary Emmys, the Edward R. Murrow Award for \"Baghdad E.R.,\" the Daniel Pearl Award/David Bloom Award/Overseas Press Club Award in recognition of his coverage of the war in Afghanistan, and the Gracie Award for his work on \"Unlikely Refugees.\"\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, NBC continues to try and enforce the news blackout. The popular American broadcasting network has taken to Twitter, asking people/reporters who repost the Turkish reports to promptly take them down. NBC News declined to comment about Engel's whereabouts, and allegedly asked Gawker not to report on \"rumors\" about Engel's current status.\n\n", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:50:03.682-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:50:03.682-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://gawker.com/5969029/richard-engel-is-missing-in-syria-nbc-news-enforces-news-blackout", "title" : "Richard Engel is Missing in Syria; NBC News Enforces News Blackout [UPDATE]", "text" : "NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel has gone missing in Syria, according to Turkish news reports. The reports also say that Aziz Akyavaş, a Turkish journalist working with Engel, is unaccounted for. NBC News has been successfully keeping Engel's status subject to a news blackout—one to which Gawker agreed until now—for at least the past 24 hours.\n\nTurkish newspaper Hurriyet is reporting that Engel and Akyavaş were last known to be in Syria and haven't been in contact with NBC News since Thursday morning. The news has been reported widely in the Turkish press over the past 24 hours, including by Turkish news channel NTV, which presents itself as an international partner of MSNBC. It's also been widely distributed on Twitter.\n\nBut NBC News has been asking every reporter who inquires about the report to participate in a news blackout. It has also taken to Twitter and asked people who repeated the Turkish reports there to take them down. You can see here a screengrab of the Twitter account @NBCComm asking a Twitter user who had mentioned the reports to urgently call a cell phone number (that account has since been taken down).\n\nNBC News declined to comment for the record about Engel's whereabouts, but asked Gawker not to report what it characterized as \"rumors\" about Engel's current status.\n\nThe Turkish reports have been referenced on Twitter by Slate's David Weigel, Michelle Malkin, former MSNBC anchor David Shuster, and hundreds of others.\n\nChinese newswire Xinhua, Daily Kos, and Breitbart.com have also both repeated the Turkish reports.\n\nWhen New York Times reporter David Rohde was kidnapped in 2008, the Times successfully maintained a months-long news blackout about his condition by arguing that the militants holding Rohde had issued specific instructions to keep his condition quiet (those claims were later undermined after Rohde escaped). An NBC News spokeswoman could not offer any detail about Engel's condition or status.\n\nUpdate: Some readers may be interested to read a more detailed explanation for why we decided to publish this post against NBC News' wishes. I supplied such an explanation to a commenter here; I've also pasted that reply below.\n\nThe rationale for the blackout was offered in off-the-record conversations, so I can't present their argument here. But I will say this: No one told me anything that indicated a specific, or even general, threat to Engel's safety. No one said, \"If you report this, then we know, or suspect, that X, Y, or Z may happen.\" It was infinitely more vague and general than that. As I wrote in the post, when the New York Times maintained a blackout about David Rohde, the rationale was clear: I was directly told that the Times had reason to believe that the people who had Rohde would harm him if news got out. There was nothing approaching that level of specificity or argumentation here. I would not have written a post if someone had told me that there was a reasonable or even remote suspicion that anything specific would happen if I wrote the post. Also: There was in practice no blackout. Xinhua and Breitbart had published English language accounts. There were probably like 100 posts to Twitter per minute about him. This was a situation where the information was freely available on the internet, and in the region—these are large Turkish outlets reporting this information.

Another account used by Anonymous, called @Anon_Central, has confirmed that Twitter pulled down the account, and it reports that the social network explained that \"you may not publish or post other people's private and confidential information.\" That quote comes directly from Twitter's terms of use, but it's not clear why this action is being taken now, as Anonymous has posted links to data dumps containing addresses and other personal information before. We have reached out to Twitter for comment on the situation.\n\nUpdate: Twitter has declined to comment, saying \"We don't comment on individual accounts for privacy and security reasons.\"\n\nUpdate 2: It appears that the suspension may have something to do with Anonymous' recent attack on the Westboro Baptist Church. A tweet from a self-proclaimed @YourAnonNews backup account has posted a screenshot of an email from Twitter, which links the suspension to a tweet that exposed personal information belonging to WBC lawyer and member Shirley Phelps-Roper.

Dust was carried by winds that gusted to as high as 66 mph at Dallas Love Field, said Jesse Moore, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.\n\nFort Worth police reported no weather-related wrecks or traffic issues overnight, said Sgt.

Nearly 3 in 4 (74%) of respondents thought it was ultimately possible to bring an end to hunger across the continent, but only 1 in 5 believed they could play an active role in solving the problem in Africa and elsewhere.\n\nThe survey suggests over-exposure to negative media and advertising portrayals of Africa and developing countries in other parts of the world may be contributing to this sense of disempowerment. Respondents described this portrayal as ‘depressing, manipulative and hopeless’, with 43% of respondents saying it made them feel that conditions for people living in the developing world would never improve. Three out of five of those polled said they were or had become desensitised to images depicting issues such as hunger, drought and disease and almost 1 in 4 (23%) admitted they turned away when confronted by such images.\n\nIn response, Oxfam’s Food for All campaign – created by RKCR/Y&R – aims to re-energise British public support for the fight to end hunger in Africa and around the world, on the grounds that while “nearly 900 million people remain hungry, there’s enough food in the world to feed everyone”.\n\nThe campaign, which breaks across newspapers, outdoor and digital media, focuses on Africa because of its overwhelming association in the public’s mind with hunger and deprivation. In another recent Oxfam poll when asked to name “the first things that come to mind when you think of Africa”, just over half (55%) of 1,295 respondents spontaneously mentioned issues relating to hunger/famine and/or poverty.\n\nFood for All comprises three creative executions, each showing an arrestingly beautiful image of Africa beneath the caption “Let’s make Africa famous for its stunning countryside/ epic landscapes / food markets. Not hunger/food shortage.” Members of the public will be asked to visit www.oxfam.org.uk/food to learn more about Oxfam’s work on food security or to text FOOD to 70066 to donate £5.\n\n“Oxfam has led the way in drawing attention to the plight of Africa’s most vulnerable people and we aren’t trying to gloss over the problems that still beset so many of them, particularly levels of malnutrition that remain stubbornly high. But we’ve come a long way since the 1980s and Band Aid’s Do They Know it’s Christmas? We need to shrug off the old stereotypes and celebrate the continent’s diversity and complexity, which is what we are attempting with this campaign.\n\n \n\n “The relentless focus on ongoing problems at the expense of a more nuanced portrait of the continent, is obscuring the progress that is being made towards a more secure and prosperous future. If we want people to help fight hunger we have to give them grounds for hope by showing the potential of countries across Africa; it’s a natural instinct to turn away from suffering when you feel you can do nothing to alleviate it.”\n\n \n\n Alongside its survey, Oxfam is also today publishing a briefing note on development progress in sub-Saharan Africa. Africa Is Wide Awake But Still Hungry underlines that countries in sub-Saharan Africa have enjoyed annual economic growth averaging 4.6% since the turn of the century. This has led to reductions in poverty levels and the rate of mortality amongst children under 5, which has dropped from 17.4% to 12.1% in the years since 1990, with the pace of decline continuing to accelerate.\n\nData from the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation suggests that over the same period there has been a marked improvement in food supply in many African countries, with the FAO rating the calories available from the average daily supply of food across sub-Saharan Africa as being 9% above the minimum level required, compared to only just sufficient in 1990. Of 45 sub-Saharan African countries with available data, 31 (69%) are deemed to have sufficient supply to ensure adequate nutrition for all their citizens, with 14 (31%) below average; 9 of those with below adequate supply are within 5% of an acceptable level.\n\nCountries making notable progress in food supply include Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique and Ethiopia, which in 1994 was 27% beneath the level of supply necessary to meet the requirements of its people, but is now 2% from being able to supply an adequate average diet to all its citizens. The data also shows the prevalence of undernourishment has fallen from 33% to 27% of the population of sub Saharan Africa since 1991.\n\nOxfam’s briefing acknowledges, however, that chronic undernourishment remains a major problem across Africa and that progress to eradicate it has stalled relative to most other regions globally. Data from the FAO reveals that despite improvements in food supply the number of people going hungry on the continent has actually increased by 37% in the last 20 years – in line with the general growth in population – predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa where 230 million are deemed to be undernourished.\n\nThe report cites two reasons why the increased availability of calories has not led to a reduction in the absolute numbers of Africans classified as under-nourished. A lack of investment and political support for small scale agriculture means that productivity remains relatively weak, with cereal yields in African lower than anywhere else in the world over the last five decades. What food there is available is also unfairly distributed, with poorer households typically having to spend up to two-thirds of their income on food.\n\nAs part of its Grow campaign, Oxfam has outlined measures that will help deliver greater food security for millions worldwide including: investment in small farms in the developing world; international agreement on climate change; better regulation of land deals to prevent land grabs; and, ending bio-fuels mandates.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:50:21.459-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:50:21.459-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2011_EN_Table1.pdf", "title" : "Human Development Reports", "text" : "Introduction to our New Director, Selim Jahan Dear friends of UNDP’s Human Development Report Office, It is with great pleasure that I greet you as the new Director of the Human Development Report Office (HDRO).

A few people showed me shrapnel wounds they suffered even though they were a fair distance from the explosion. There was little that people could do but watch, with some trying to get photographs of the incident on their mobile phones.

There is nothing particularly novel about these drills; the Velayat 90 exercises were held just over a year ago, and Velayat 89 took place 19 months before that.\n\nEven the United States, Israel and their allies participated in war games in the area this September; the IMCMEX-12 naval exercises in the Gulf focused on clearing sea mines.\n\nBut many in the West are wary of any Iranian defense activities in the strait, given the waterway’s immense commercial and geopolitical significance. The Strait of Hormuz curves sharply between Iran and Oman, at one point narrowing down to a mere 21 miles across. Its small size belies its critical importance to world commerce, especially when it comes to oil.\n\n“The Strait of Hormuz is the world's most important oil chokepoint due to its daily oil flow of about 17 million [barrels per day] in 2011,” reports the U.S. Energy Information Administration. “Flows through the Strait in 2011 were roughly 35 percent of all seaborne traded oil, or almost 20 percent of oil traded worldwide.”\n\nAs Western sanctions against Iran tighten in response to the regime’s pursuit of nuclear technology, Tehran sees the strait as a key bargaining tool.\n\n“If Iran oil is banned, not a single drop of oil will pass through Hormuz Strait,\" threatened Vice President Mohammad Reza Rahimi in December of last year.\n\nSince then, however, that rhetoric has died down and other officials have vowed to keep the waterway open as long as Iranian ships can still use it.\n\nIf Iran ever followed through on threats to disrupt oil shipments in the strait even temporarily, energy prices could skyrocket. Some analysts have predicted that the price of oil could increase by 50 percent within a matter of days, according to the New York Times.\n\nBut there’s no cause for alarm just yet, according to Tehran. Even though the Navy has urged caution to any ships that had planned to pass through the straight during Velayat 91, Navy Rear Admiral Amir Rastegari told state media on Saturday, “the Navy has issued no warnings. In accordance with the international norms, announcements should be sent for the information of the ships passing by during any military drill in order to prevent any potential damages.”", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:50:31.376-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:50:31.376-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2012/12/2012122862357402782.html", "title" : "Iran starts war games in Strait of Hormuz", "text" : "Iran has started six days of naval drills in the Strait of Hormuz aimed at showcasing its military capabilities in what is a vital oil and gas shipping route, the official IRNA news agency reported.

Iran's state TV reported that Tehran had warned ships to stay away from the site until January 3. The drills come as the West increases its pressure over Iran's nuclear programme. The West suspects it may be aimed at producing nuclear weapons, a charge Iran denies.\n\n\n\nIranian officials have often said Iran could block the strait - through which 40 percent of the world's sea-borne oil\n\nexports pass - if it came under military attack over its disputed nuclear programme.\n\n\n\nIran held a similar 10-day drill last December and sent a submarine and a destroyer into the Gulf four months ago just as US and allied navies were conducting exercises in the same waters to practice keeping oil shipping lanes open.\n\n\n\nSayyari was quoted as saying on Tuesday that the new drill would test the navy's missile systems, combat ships, submarines and patrol and reconnaissance methods.\n\n\n\nA heavy Western naval presence in the Gulf is meant to deter any attempt to block the waterway.", "image" : "", "authors" : [], "created_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:50:32.601-0400" }, "updated_at" : { "$date" : "2014-09-14T08:50:32.601-0400" } }, { "ext_url" : "http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57561071/iran-says-its-started-naval-drills-at-strait-of-hormuz/", "title" : "Iran says it's started naval drills at Strait of Hormuz", "text" : "TEHRAN, Iran Iran's state TV is reporting the country's navy has begun maneuvers in the area of the Strait of Hormuz, where one-fifth of the world's oil passes.\n\nIt says the maneuvers began early Friday, involving warships, submarines jet fighters and hovercrafts.\n\nThe drills come as the West increases its pressure over Iran's nuclear program.
